%%%%%%%%%%% TBP on Ag(100) @ RT - single ordered island
\paragraph{Ordered areas}
Only a single ordered area of TBP on Ag(100) was found, but its structure could not be resolved properly due to tip issues (compare figure \ref{fig:hex-TBP-Ag100}). Its unit cell looks hexagonal with roughly \SI{1.7} {\nano \meter} period.
