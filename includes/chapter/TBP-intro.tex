%TBP intro
\label{section:TBP}
Within this section, TBP molecules with are investigated. The number (1-2) and position (single-, cis-, trans-configuration) of the very same functional group is changed. Although first the results on metal surfaces are presented, one of the ideas of the following experiments is to use the dipole moment of the single functionalized molecule to orient it along the work function change of a \textit{h}-BN/Cu(111) sample. Please refer to \autoref{chapter:used-molecules} for detailed information on these molecules. 

Preparations with the single nitro functionalized species are done at RT on Cu(111), \textit{h}-BN/Cu-foil and Ag(100). The Ag(100) preparation was heated to \SI{170}{\celsius}. 

Preparations with the trans functionalization are performed at RT on Ag(100) and Cu(111) where the last was heated to \SI{120}{\celsius}.

Evaporation of the cis functionalization were not performed, although tried intensively no molecules were sublimated in the OMBE and found on the sample. This indicates strong intermolecular interaction within the crucible like cluster formation or polymerization, which have to happen before the molecules sublimate.

Similar molecules have been investigated on a reconstructed Au(111) surface \cite{yokoyama_selective_2001}.
