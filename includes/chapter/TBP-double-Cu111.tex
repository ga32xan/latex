When depositing trans-TBP on Cu(111) at room temperature no long range ordering can be achieved. The molecules arrange rather arbitrarily as can be seen in  \autoref{fig:two-leg-trans-cu111-rt}.

The molecules tend to connect in a defined angle to its next neighbor, forming different binding motifs. These are predominantly different kind of chain formation (see figure \ref{fig:two-leg-trans-cu111-motifs}).
\begin{itemize}
 \item The molecules are ordered such that they form a straight chain (\autoref{trans-nitro-on-cu111-70-straight-chain}).
 \item The molecules arrange in chains, but each molecule has an offset of about a half of its width to the next neighbor or the molecules attach in chains, but show a kink. \autoref{trans-nitro-on-cu111-70-shifted-chain}
\end{itemize}

During modeling \autoref{fig:two-leg-trans-cu111-motifs-1} several points became clear. 
\begin{itemize}
	\item First consider the even apparent height of the di-tert-butyl groups. It indicates that both groups in a legs have comparable heights and it is likely that the phenyl ring bearing these groups is rotated for an even alignment of the tert-butyl groups with regard to the substrate level.
	\item Orientation of di-tert-butyl phenyl groups is the same within a single molecule but alternates (by $\approx \SI{10}{\degree}$) in neighboring molecules in a chain. This is indicated by blue and green lines in \autoref{trans-nitro-on-cu111-70-straight-chain}, each representing a common orientation.
	\item Second the minor contrast variations in the central porphine core change as the orientation of the di-tert-butyl-groups. Free base porphine core is likely to adsorb with its axis  - formed by opposing nitrogens in the core - aligned parallel to the dense packed crystal direction\cite{rojas_surface_2012}. In the present case, the molecule is lifted from the substrate by the bulky di-tert-butyl groups. Hence the porphine core interaction with the crystal substrate is considerable lower than in the 2H-P case. Still, every second molecule has the same orientation, while neighboring molecules are rotated by \SI{30}{\degree}.
	\item The gap between di-tert-butyl-phenyl groups of neighboring molecules is larger on one side of the chain than on the other and shows a larger apparent height (white arrows in \autoref{trans-nitro-on-cu111-70-straight-chain}). Although identification of surface ad-atoms is not straightforward with an STM, they are believed to originate from the copper surface.
\end{itemize} 
The best fitting model consists of molecules with a center-center distance of \SI{1.9 \pm 0.1}{\nano \meter}

Having a closer look to the nitro groups, one recognizes a close proximity of these to each other. Also note the light protrusions in between two adjacent molecules' butyl groups (adatom?). If the legs are rotated by just \SI{15}{\degree}, the nitro groups would point to these protrusions. This rotation costs not much energy and is about \SI{25}{\kilo\J/per\mol} \textcolor{red}{\textbf{(( please cite something, value is for rotated phenyl ring at a porphine core I guess ))}}. Considering these protrusions as Cu-ad atoms (already occurred in chapter \ref{chapter:TPCN-adatoms} as protrusions in between TPCN chains which may change their position in discrete position in the molecule.) This Cu-ad atom may direct the binding of the nitro groups towards it, making them bend outwards. The position of the cooper atom itself may rely on its registry to the substrate - preferring a threefold coordination site as known for copper  \textcolor{red}{\textbf{(( citation ))}}.

The second motif is a chain motif, too. Orientation of molecular axis and dense packed substrate atom rows are the same and again the di-tert-butyl groups orient along them. The difference is a lateral offset between the molecules to shift each of them by half a molecules width. The center-center distances are \SI{1.9 \pm 0.1}{\nano \meter}. It is harder to quantify a possible orientation of the nitro-phenyl groups, since as well straight as well as bended configurations match the assembly. In this binding motif, stable connections between molecules are most likely due to nitro-phenyl groups pointing to di-tert-butyl groups and therefor stabilizing the assembly.
