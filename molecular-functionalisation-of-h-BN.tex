% If errors occure referring to aux files or others:
%	Delete helper files (*.aux) and maybe others!
%
% Use MikTeX version 2.9.6615 or later (check that biber is included)
% Using BiBLaTex, biber as frontend.
% If biber complains (ERROR - Error: Found biblatex control file version 2.6, expected version 3.4.)
% 	Update with your Miktex package manager (mpm_mfc.exe[single user install] or mpm_mfc_admin.exe [all user install])
% no new biblatex version there? Sync database? NO improvement!

\chapter{Experimental methods}
Several experimental methods are used within this work to determine different physical properties. In this chapter we review the principles, benefits and limitations for each method. All of them are well known in surface science and used to analyze thin films on different substrates with respect to their geometric, electronic and chemical properties.

\chapter{Experimental setup and sample preparation}
To conduct experiments in the most controlled environment possible, sample preparation is done in ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) chambers. With a base pressure of $\approx \SI{1e-10}{\milli \bar}$ these stainless steel chambers are virtually free of contaminants. After cleaning the metallic substrates, ad-layers and molecular species are deposited and investigated without contaminations of residual gases.  Experiments were done at three different experimental chambers: (1) A LT-STM chamber. The technical aspects of the preparation and experimental chamber are discussed elsewhere \cite{urgel_tendero_two-dimensional_2015, schwarz_assembly_2018, wiengarten_scanning_2015} and shortly summarized here. (2) A RT-STM with XPS capabilities. The technical aspects and build details are given in \cite{schwarz_assembly_2018}. (3) The NIM-XPS chamber. This chamber is chosen because of it is possible to investigate chemical properties and coverage with XPS while an UV-Vis spectrometer is used to access the electronic structure of the occupied states. (4) A LT-AFM machine offers a complementary investigation method for geometric information. Its setup details can be found in \cite{he_bottom-up_2017}.

  \section{Experimental setup}

  \section{Surfaces and ad-layers}
  Single crystals of copper and silver (terminated for (111) and (100) surfaces) are used as substrates as well as polycrystalline copper foils. All of them are used to deposit molecules. Some experiments are done to investigate molecules on \textit{h}-BN/Cu(111) and \textit{h}-BN/Cu(foil). The following sections will describe the relevant physical properties of the various substrates and will introduce a method to prepare polycrystalline copper foils to grow \textit{h}-BN on.
