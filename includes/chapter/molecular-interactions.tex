``How surface bonding and repulsive interactions cause phase transformations`` 
example: 2H-P on Ag(111): \textbf{see Notice-Book}

The ordering of the molecules is induced by:
\begin{itemize}
 \item [attractive interactions:]
 \item formation of regular arrangements in sub-ML regime due to the short range character of interactions
 \item homogeneous structuring only (if at all) possible at high coverages
 \item [$\rightarrow$] different structural domains with domain boundaries
 \item [repulsive interactions:]
 \item molecules behave like lattice gas
 \item this leads to homogeneous distribution with decreasing distance between molecules when increasing the coverages
 \item no domain boundaries
 \item change redistribution on substrate due to molecule adsorption $\rightarrow$ electronic templating of substrate
 \item Molecular self-assembly may be affected by the electronic change at molecule/substrate interface
\end{itemize}
