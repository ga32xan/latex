%\section{Motivation}
In this chapter copper foils are first chemically polished and prepared for investigation in SEM (p. \pageref{fig:SEM-gb}), AFM (p. \pageref{fig:foil-afm-as-bought}) and STM (p. \pageref{fig:cu-foil-clean-stm}). 

After CVD growth of \textit{h}-BN with borazine, foils are investigated in STM (\autoref{fig:h-bn-overgrown-cu}) and XPS (compare \autoref{fig:xps-self-grown}). 

A commercially available \textit{h}-BN/Cu-foil is investigated in XPS after stepwise annealing to \SI{970}{\kelvin} (p. \pageref{sec:commercial-hBN-XPS}). 

At the end of the chapter (p. \pageref{sec:foil-use-case}) a use case shows that replacement of single crystals with polycrystalline foils is feasible for some applications.

%Comparable experiments  are performed by \cite[8]{stables_report_2008}). 

	\section{Pre-treatment of Cu-foils: Polishing}
	
	\paragraph{Experiment realization}The first attempt to etch the Cu-foil was performed with the $5\%_{vol}$ EG, $25\%_{vol}\,H_2O$ filled up with phosphoric acid. The etching was performed in a \SI{200}{\ml} beaker, filled with \SI{150}{\ml} etching solution. The potential was adjusted to be \SI{1.2}{\V} during the polishing process. The current through the solution changes and is typically highest when the polishing process started (\SI{120}{\milli \ampere}). 
	
After some minutes the foils reflectivity changes. The surface - shiny before etching - becomes hazy. After some more time the foils reflectivity improves again. 
	
	The time spend for polishing depends on the handling (like shaking the beaker or moving the foil in the solution). When no visual change to the surface is observed the etching process is interrupted.\footnote{Since the perfect voltage/current to perform polishing varies in time a automated etching process has been developed. \cite{palmieri_besides_2001}}
	
During the etching process, as more and more copper settles on the counter electrode, the current and therefore the etching rate decreases continuously. When the beaker is moved, some of the debris on the electrode changes the electrode's surrounding and the etching rate (limiting current) increases again. 
	
	Front- and backside of the foil are suspect to different etching processes. The back side is generally more flat, the side facing the counter electrode always shows some additional protrusions.

The foil is cleaned from remaining etchants with purified water first and isopropanol afterwards. Foils are stored in isopropanol to avoid degradation under moist, oxygen rich ambient conditions.

	\subsection{SEM characterization} 
	One of the foils is blown dry with nitrogen to remove isopropyl alcohol remnants and is put into the loading stage of a \textbf{s}canning \textbf{e}lectron \textbf{m}icroscope (SEM). After operating conditions are met, a series of images is recorded to characterize the overall surface structure of the foil. 
	
\autoref{fig:SEM-1} shows a typical surface area. It is apparent that it is imaged in different intensities. According to \cite{wu_effects_2015, wendt_correlation_2007, langlois_crystal_2015} these are attributed to the copper grain orientation within the foil due to their differing resistivity. The derived grain size ranges from a few \SI{}{\micro \meter} to several hundred \SI{}{\micro \meter}. Many grains show distinct intensity differences compared to their neighbors, e.g. in the center region are several easily distinguishable grains. But there are regions where a similar grain intensity makes it hard to attribute different grains to a surface area.
	
A border region is shown in \autoref{fig:SEM-2} with larger magnification. Two grains are separated by a boundary running from top left to bottom center. It is irregularly shaped and does not show a preferred direction of propagation.

Three darker circles in the top left image indicate the presence of different etching rates. Their origin is attributed to the presence of gaseous bubbles that hinder the etchant to immerse the copper surface at all times. The different surface treatment results in a change in contrast in SEM. These features are not frequent enough to co-determine the surface structure.

Smaller bright spots are spread across the image area. Here the conductivity of the specimen is larger so that more electrons are accounted for in the detector. Their size is much smaller and they appear on every image. No long range order can be found but they show similarities to features present for crystal defects after etching. 

The copper foil shows different surface morphologies. While some areas of the appear as  wavy structure in SEM, others are much flatter and appear in a different intensity. \autoref{fig:SEM-3} displays a grain that appears darker than its surrounding and  incorporates several bright small spots. The outline shows different corner geometries so that the overall shape of the grain appears asymmetric. Although the contrast between neighboring grains is clearly visible for this first example, a second smaller, elongated grain is embedded in the lower right part of the copper foil. Its contrast resembles the surrounding, but a border is visible as dark lines. In contrast to the first example, the inside of the grain merges with its surrounding via many small connections and blurs the grain appearance. Although the contrast and morphology is very similar, the copper grain appears to change its orientation.
	
No direct determination of the grains' facet orientation has been done due to the lack of EBSD-data in the used SEM setup.

	After etching (U=\SI{1.2}{\volt}, I=\SIrange{120}{250}{\mA} for \SI{5}{\hour} with solution shown in \autoref{tab:composition-etching-solution-I}) the striations vanish and the RMS value decreases by \SI{50}{\percent}. An increase in foil reflectivity is visible with bare eyes. \autoref{fig:foil-afm-as-bought} show RT-AFM images in the same size and contrast - before \subref{fig:foil-bought-afm} and after \subref{fig:foil-polished-afm} etching.
	The over all structure changes from a heterogeneous sample height to a more even height distribution with far less steep ridges. Those are sufficiently separated in space to exhibit flat regions where the \textit{h}-BN may grow unperturbed. The circular depression is an result of bubbles affecting the rate of etching.
	
\subsection{LT-STM characterization}
\label{section:foil-STM}
The bought and chemically polished foils are mounted on a sample holder and loaded into the load lock. It is evacuated for \SIrange{2}{3}{\hour}, afterwards the valve is opened to the chamber. During transfer, no noteable increase in the base pressure is noted. The sample is put on the parking slot.
		
The sample was initially degassed with slowly increasing temperatures to remove adsorbates like $CO, CO_2$ and $H_2O$.
		
After some time of degassing, the sample was prepared with repeated sputter and anneal cycles. The annealing temperatures were increased up to \SI{800}{\degreeCelsius}. 
The sample was cooled down and observed in LT-STM.
		
Further experiments were carried out to increase the cleanliness of the \textit{h}-BN on the polycrystalline copper foil. To reduce the amount of elements coming from the body of the foil, it is repeatedly sputtered and annealed to temperatures as high as \SI{800}{\celsius}. This may have also a positive influence on the grain size and amount of corrugation. Several attempts have been made which are described in summary below.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
After cleaning, the sample is investigated in STM. The foil shows a in-homogeneous topography, with parts of the sample showing very flat regions while others still remain heavily corrugated and not scan able in STM.  A look onto the quite heterogeneous surface reveals flat areas with a typical roughness of $\approx \SI{70}{\pico\meter}$ exist (\autoref{fig:cu-foil-clean-stm-1}). Areas with very large corrugations $\geq \SI{100}{nm}$ exist and are hard to scan in STM and certainly bad places for \textit{h}-BN growth. Although being flat, the poly-crystalline foil shows a faceted surface with no long range order.

\section{CVD-Growth of \textit{h}-BN with borazine}
The sample was sputtered and annealed several times to temperatures of \SI{800}{\celsius}. Before the dosage it was held 5 minutes at \SI{750}{\celsius}. Borazine was dosed with the same pressure as before (\SI{1e-7}{\milli \bar}) but for \SI{1}{\minute} and at a lower temperature of \SI{750}{\celsius}. After the preparation the sample was kept at \SI{750}{\celsius} for another minute. It was cooled down slowly.
	 \subsection{LT-STM characterization}
%The foil was sputtered and annealed 4 times with temperatures of \SI{800}{\celsius}. Borazine was dosed at \SI{2e-7}{\milli \bar} for \SI{2.5}{\minute}. The sample was kept at \SI{750}{\celsius} for another 5 minutes after dosing. The sample was cooled down slowly. \autoref{fig:h-bn-overgrown-cu-1} shows some of the grown islands. The copper surface changes upon \textit{h}-BN growth and the terrace width increases below the \textit{h}-BN flakes. The typical faceting of the surface vanishes or can at least not be depicted because of the overgrowing \textit{h}-BN (\autoref{fig:h-bn-overgrown-cu-2}).

\autoref{fig:h-bn-overgrown-cu} shows an area with sub-ML \textit{h}-BN coverage. As an guide to the eye, the \textit{h}-BN islands are overlaid with a blueish hue in \autoref{fig:h-bn-22L-2}. In between flat, triangular \textit{h}-BN domains the faceted copper surface can be seen.

It is apparent that the surface structure changes between free copper and \textit{h}-BN regions. While the facets are clearly visible on free copper areas, the overgrowing \textit{h}-BN creates a new surface where the faceted copper surface is not visible anymore. In most of the overgrown areas wider terraces are formed that are divided by almost straight step edges that roughly follow the facets orientation.

Different \textit{h}-BN structures are visible in \autoref{fig:h-bn-22L}. While most islands (I) do not show much internal structure, some (II) show some apparent height variations in STM. They overgrow the facets and mask their height profile like the structure-less islands but terraces are connected by unregular shaped step edges. These typically do not follow facet orientation and two neighboring terraces are separated by a smaller height difference.  No relation between island orientation and type (I / II) can be found.

The surface structure is varying across the image. Regions with square (top left corner) and hexagonal (center) symmetric step edges are found in close proximity but only occur below overgrown areas for island type (I). 

Height profiles are taken for several facets. The angle between rising and falling facet fronts is compared with typical facet angles at single crystal surfaces but no clear assignment can be done. Higher order facet orientations are discussed in \autoref{fig:step-heights}. The facet orientation varies slightly across the image.

\subsection{XPS characterization}
%this file contains information on self-grown \textit{h}-BN on the comercially bought copper foils
%Copper foils with \SI{0.25}{\mm} were bought and repeatedly sputtered/annealed. Several grow cycles of \textit{h}-BN via CVD of borazine were done.  
The sample is transferred to the XPS-STM chamber and again sputtered/annealed several times to clean it properly.

The needed dosage of borazine to assemble a full mono layer of \textit{h}-BN is derived via a combined STM/XPS measurement. Several preparations were done to understand the growth behavior of \textit{h}-BN on the copper foil. Coverage is measured in STM while the chemical composition of the sample was assessed with XPS.

When comparing the resulting coverage (STM coverage/XPS signal) (II) to the (saturated) mono layer (I) one can derive the minimal amount of borazine needed to process a mono layer of \textit{h}-BN on the copper foil. Comparing the coverages of a sample grown with CVD, \SI{7E-6}{\milli \bar} for 15min (I) and one grown with CVD, \SI{3.5E-6}{\milli \bar} for 5min (II), shows that reducing the dosage by a factor of 6 does not reduce the coverage by a factor of 6, but instead by a factor of 2. Therefore (I) features a full monolayer and (II) only half of it. It follows that a full monolayer may be achieved by dosing at least \SI{1500}{\langmuir} borazine on a \SI{800}{\degreeCelsius} hot copper foil surface. 
Because the growth rate may certainly not be linear (less and less free copper surface to decompose borazine into building fragments while the layer assembles) the given dosage is a minimum estimation to achieve the mono layer.

Even though a much larger amount for borazine (\SI{4736}{\langmuir}) than needed for a mono layer (\SI{1500}{\langmuir}) has been dosed, the maximum coverage did not exeed ne XPS signal of a mono layer. So the growth of \textit{h}-BN on copper foil is self-limited (as in the case of many \textit{h}-BN/metal systems) to a full mono layer. It is not possible to achieve layer growth with this type of preparation.

T and t dependence is not subject to investigation because the growth is supposed to follow the same mechanisms as on the single-crystal case. Quiet some investigation has been done, \cite{orlando_epitaxial_2012,preobrajenski_monolayer_2007-1} to understand this process.

The XPS spectra shows contribution of different atomic species. There are peaks for the O-atoms (1s: \SIrange{529}{535}{\eV})), C-atoms (1s $\approx \SI{285}{\eV}$), N-atoms (1s $\approx \SI{398}{\eV}$), B-atoms (1s $\approx \SI{190}{\eV}$) and Cu-atoms ($3p_{1/2,3/2}$: \SIrange{70}{80}{\eV})). One would expect the shape of the 1s-peaks to be singlet-like (one peak, gauss shaped) and the 3p-peak to be a doublet (two close lying peaks with area-ratio 1/2:3/2=1:2).

There are different oxygen containing species expected to be present on the unprepared sample surface, including $CO$/$CO_2$, $CuO$/$Cu_2O$ and $H_2O$. They are possible surface contaminants due to sample storage under atmospheric conditions.
\paragraph{O1s}
Position varies with temperature. The signal at room temperature(black) stems from adsorbed water and CO. These desorb with increasing temperature(blue). When going to higher temperatures(red) this peak increases again and shifts to higher binding energies. Not present in self-grown \textit{h}-BN (\autoref{fig:xps-self-grown})

The C1s Peak decreases with increasing temperature and retains its position. This has the same  reason as for the O1s peak (desorption of CO due to the heating). Some of the carbon remains on the surface - even at temperatures as high as \SI{970}{\K}.

\paragraph{N1s/B1s}
The nitrogen/boron peaks show some temperature related changes. There is little change upon annealing to \SI{630}{\K}, both peaks shrink, but stay almost constant in their position in binding energy (sightly shifted to lower binding energies by about \SI{0.2}{\eV}). Position is [N1s: \SI{398.1}{\eV} | B1s: \SI{190.2}{\eV}]. Further annealing leads to a intensity decrease.

\paragraph{Cu3p}
The copper peak exhibits an increase in area when increasing the temperature. This is because some of the water and CO adsorbate desorb and more and more copper is contributing to the signal. This peak is a doublet, so both signals come from the same chemical copper surrounding.


The $Cu(OH)_2$ O1s peak is expected to be at \SIrange{531.3}{531.7}{\eV}\cite{deroubaix_x-ray_1992} which may explain the shoulder of the O1s peak to higher binding energies (O\textit{1s} metal: \SI{531}{\eV}). Nitrates ($NO_3$) have binding energies in the range from \SIrange{532.5}{533.5}{\eV}\cite[45]{wanger_handbook_1979}. This would imply either an replacement of nitrogen with oxygen, or some kind of oxygen on top or below the the BN layer. As proven by Simonov et al. in \cite{simonov_controllable_2012} the atomic oxygen tends to replace the nitrogen in the \textit{h}-BN/Ir(111) system when it is annealed to \SI{600}{\degreeCelsius}. Thus it forms $B_{x}N_{y}O_{1-x-y}$ over-layers. The longer the oxidation time the higher the amount of replaced nitrogen. 

If this effect is responsible for the O\textit{1s} peak at high temperatures is questionable, since the oxygen has to be cracked somehow - where no process can be thought of (no catalytic cracking at metal surface possible - full ML, thermal energy to low to reach binding energies of $O_2$.

\textbf{An exchange of O with B or N would be easily visible in XPS (due to changed N/B surroundings. Not sure if the signal of oxygen is large enough for that.}

\subsection{Application: Molecular adsoprtion of TPCN}

To test the use of polycrystalline copper foils in molecular adsorption experiments, the Cu(111) support for the \textit{h}-BN growth is replaced by a polycrystalline copper foil. The \textit{h}-BN layer has been prepared by a dose of \SI{5E-7}{\milli\bar} borazine for \SI{20}{\min} (\SI{4500}{\L}) at the LT-STM chamber. During dosage the foil has been kept at \SI{820}{\celsius}. 

Here carbonitrile-functionalized porphyrin (2H-TPCN) molecules are used as molecular building blocks, as these have been studied in the past with single crystalline supports.\cite{urgel_controlling_2015} After Co dosage they show regular metal-organic coordination networks on \textit{h}-BN/Cu(111).
%  
%  When a \textit{h}-BN spacer layer is introduced, the molecules decouple from the substrate, lowering their interaction with the afore-mentioned. This can be seen in a change of the molecules' footprint (rectangular $\rightarrow$ square ).
%  
%  They do not form ordered networks (like chains or squares) and lie rather loosely on the \textit{h}-BN layer (\textcolor{red}{\textbf{compare 150807.142226.dat}}). They can easily be moved with the STM tip (\SI{1}{\volt}, \SI{10}{\nano \ampere}). In some areas, denser TPCN islands form. Here they lie right next to each other, slightly shifted to match the neighboring molecules and to achieve the dense packed regions. The same motif was already investigated in the same system \cite{urgel_controlling_2015}, hardening the assumption of a decoupling \textit{h}-BN layer.
%  
%  During scanning ($I=\SI{0.1}{\nA},\ \SI{0.9}{\V}<U<\SI{1.3}{\V}$) of a group of molecules, a single molecule could be pushed out of the group (compare figure \autoref{fig:TPCN-manipulation} in appendix). While the chain initially consisted of 3 molecules in a row, after scanning one of the molecular units moved to the left while the remaining two stay at their positions. A closer look to the moved molecule's geometry reveals deformation of the legs.\textcolor{red}{\textbf{More information or don't mention?}}
%  
%  It was shown that the imminic nitrogen species within a 2H-TPP molecule strongly interact a Cu(111) surface, thus orient along high symmetry directions.\cite{haq_clean_2011, buchner_diffusion_2011, gonzalez-moreno_following_2011, diller_self-metalation_2012, ditze_activation_2012,rojas_self-assembly_2010} 
%  Rotation and diffusion are limited. \textcolor{red}{\textbf{What does this tell me? Molecules on Cu(111) are all oriented the same or rotated by \SI{90}{\degree} or \SI{60}{\degree}? Thats a $\pm$ \SI{30}{\degree}}}
% 
% TPCN without added cobalt form similar pattern on the \textit{h}-BN/Cu-foil system (compare fig. 2b in \cite{urgel_controlling_2015}). Although the ordered areas were quiet rare, an arranged region has been found. Here the molecules are not strictly equidistant or -rotated which makes it difficult to give an accurate unit cell for this type of motif.

Unveiling the structure of the island beginning at its edges shows the orientation and lateral position of the molecules which is highlighted by dashed outlines in \autoref{fig:TPCN+Co-STM-large}. The molecular center is shown in black while the leg functionalization is shown in blue.

The molecules form a regular 2D network and arrange in a square unit cell with center-center distances of \SI{2.43 \pm 0.05}{\nano \meter}. All molecules within are rotated the same and connected by their CN functions via Co atoms. 

A Co atom connecting two neighboring molecules via their legs results in a distance of \SI{2.81 \pm 0.05}{\angstrom} between the N terminated leg and Co atom. Typical binding distances for Co-NC are reported \cite{schlickum_metalorganic_2007, przychodzen_supramolecular_2006} and in good agreement.

Two defects are visible in \autoref{fig:TPCN+Co-STM-small} as depressions in the otherwise regular cobalt lattice connecting the molecules. A missing Co atom leads to a symmetric, cross like depression in the apparent height. The four protrusions resemble the shape of intact functional groups.

A defect asymmetric in shape is visible in the lower half of \autoref{fig:TPCN+Co-STM-small}. Here the connection between four molecules is distorted. While three of four legs appear regular in shape and point to the central cobalt atom, a single leg appears different. This is attributed to an altered function of the leg, likely due to the loss of the pyridil group.

Few signs for porphyrin center metalization, neither many access cobalt ad atoms (additional bright spots in between the molecular assembly) are observed. 

The same mechanisms are present for 2H-TPCN/\textit{h}-BN/Cu(111)+Co \cite{urgel_controlling_2015} and show the resemblance of \textit{h}-BN grown on Cu(111) and polycrystalline copper foils as molecular assembly support.

\section{Summary \& Outlook}
  \begin{itemize}

The surface roughness of polycrystalline copper foils has been improved with the chemical polish approach. After polishing the foil a decrease in surface roughness of about \SI{50}{\percent} is achieved. After several sputter and annealing cycles, \textit{h}-BN can be grown on alike prepared foils. The quality of the grown \textit{h}-BN is good and allows for molecular adsorption experiments, that reproduce experimental results on \textit{h}-BN grown on Cu(111) as tested for TPCN + Co.

The prepared \textit{h}-BN/Cu-foils were compared to bought \textit{h}-BN/Cu-foils in XPS experiments. For the commercial available samples the binding energy for nitrogen and boron is lower by $\approx \SI{500}{\milli \eV}$. Both show carbon peaks. While the C\textit{1s} signal for the experimentally prepared sample is small, it is considerable for the bought samples and could not completely be removed via gentle heating. For the bought samples oxygen contamination is present and annealing did not show a complete removal of the contaminants.

Some foil has been mechanically polished with 4k paper and several hours of Syton polishing. The roughness of these samples has been investigated in AFM, too. It is comparable to the chemically polished ones, but always larger by $\approx \SI{10}{\percent}$. Sometimes unwanted new scratches appear after mechanical polish.

To further improve the quality of the foil, one could follow the documented recipe for annealing the foil in a $H_2$ atmosphere (\SI{10}{sscm}, \SI{1000}{\celsius}, 30min)\cite{kim_synthesis_2012} to increase the copper grain size and further smoothen the surface.
