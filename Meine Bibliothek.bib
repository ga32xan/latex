In another set of experiments, Kondo effect creates a number of characteristic features in the electron transport through small electronic devices -- semiconductor quantum dots or single-molecule transistors which can be tuned by applying appropriate gate voltages. The article contains 5 color figures, photo of Jun Kondo, but no equations.},

	abstract = {We measured the elastic properties and intrinsic breaking strength of free-standing monolayer graphene membranes by nanoindentation in an atomic force microscope. The force-displacement behavior is interpreted within a framework of nonlinear elastic stress-strain response, and yields second- and third-order elastic stiffnesses of 340 newtons per meter (N m–1) and –690 Nm–1, respectively. The breaking strength is 42 N m–1 and represents the intrinsic strength of a defect-free sheet. These quantities correspond to a Young's modulus of E = 1.0 terapascals, third-order elastic stiffness of D = –2.0 terapascals, and intrinsic strength of σint = 130 gigapascals for bulk graphite. These experiments establish graphene as the strongest material ever measured, and show that atomically perfect nanoscale materials can be mechanically tested to deformations well beyond the linear regime.},

This pattern shows three distinct regions resulting from different local configurations of the carbon adlayer with respect to the Ir-substrate. These regions are imaged differently by {STM} and differ strongly in their ability to bind metal deposits.},

	volume = {26},
	issn = {0021-521X},
	abstract = {Effects of catecholamines and their inhibitors on the electrical activity of the smooth muscle of the guinea-pig stomach were studied by using pressure electrodes. The spontaneous electrical activity of antrum and corpus preparations consisted of slow waves with or without superimposed spikes. In quiescent fundus preparations, the spike activity and slow waves were generated by {TEA}. Catecholamines (noradrenaline, isoprenaline and adrenaline) suppressed or blocked the spike discharges and the generation of slow waves. However, the spike activity was enhanced at a higher concentration of phenylephrine in the antrumand fundus preparations. Inhibitory responses of the smooth muscles from whole regions to adrenaline, noradrenaline or isoprenaline were antagonized by propranolol or {DCI} but not by phentolamine or phenoxybenzamine. Therefore, inhibitory actions of these amines appear to involve beta-adrenoceptors. After treatment with tetrodotoxin, noradrenaline and isoprenaline blocked the spike activity and the generation of slow waves. Phenylephrine or adrenaline potentiated the spike activity in the presence of tetrodotoxin. After treatment with {DCI} or propranolol, phenylephrine potentiated the spike activity of the antrum and fundus preparations. These excitatory effects were antagonized by phentolamine or phenoxybenzamine. It is concluded that excitatory actions of these amines are mediated by alpha-adrenoceptors rather than via a nervous pathway.},

	abstract = {Engineering the electronic structure of organics through interface manipulation, particularly the interface dipole and the barriers to charge carrier injection, is of essential importance to improve organic devices. This requires the meticulous fabrication of desired organic structures by precisely controlling the interactions between molecules. The well-known principles of organic coordination chemistry cannot be applied without proper consideration of extra molecular hybridization, charge transfer and dipole formation at the interfaces. Here we identify the interplay between energy level alignment, charge transfer, surface dipole and charge pillow effect and show how these effects collectively determine the net force between adsorbed porphyrin 2H-{TPP} on Cu(111). We show that the forces between supported porphyrins can be altered by controlling the amount of charge transferred across the interface accurately through the relative alignment of molecular electronic levels with respect to the Shockley surface state of the metal substrate, and hence govern the self-assembly of the molecules.},

Colored, particulate hide powder-azure, membrane fractions and soluble proteins such as hemoglobin, casein or albumin were susceptible to hydrolysis by the membraneous protease. Partial purification of the enzyme was accomplished through disc-gel electrophoresis on polyacrylamide in the presence of 0.25\% positively charged detergents like cetyltrimethylammonium bromide. An alkaline protease ({pH} 7.4) with properties similar to those of the erythrocyte enzyme was found in leucocytes. The similarity between the properties of the leucocytic and erythrocytic proteases and the correlation of the activity in erythrocyte membranes with content of white cells in these preparations, suggest that enzymatic activities in the contaminating leucocytes are responsible for the activity of membraneous proteases in erythrocytes.},

	abstract = {The formation of a hexagonal boron nitride (h-{BN}) layer through dissociation of borazine (B3N3H6) molecules on Ir(111) has been investigated by a combination of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure, temperature-programmed desorption, and low-energy electron diffraction. At low temperature (T = 170 K), molecular borazine adsorption occurs with the plane of the benzene-like ring parallel to the substrate. Dehydrogenation is observed at temperatures higher than 250 K and extends up to 900 K, with a maximum H2 desorption rate around 300 K. Besides dehydrogenation, room temperature adsorption of borazine leads to the formation of atomic and molecular fragments due to the break-up of part of the {BN} bonds. The epitaxial growth of h-{BN} starts at temperature higher than 1000 K where an extended and long-range ordered layer is obtained. The presence of a corrugation in the h-{BN} layer with moiré periodicity of (13 x 13)/(12 x 12) {BN}/Ir unit cell is reflected in the double component structure of the B 1s and N 1s core level spectra.},

	abstract = {The adsorption of hydrogen, ethylene, acetylene, cyclohexane and benzene was studied on both the (111) and stepped [6(111)x(100)] crystal surfaces of iridium. The techniques used were low energy electron diffraction, Auger electron spectroscopy, and thermal desorption mass spectrometry. At 30°C, acetylene, ethylene and benzene are adsorbed with a sticking probability near unity. The sticking probability of cyclohexane is less than 0.1 on both surfaces. Heating the (111) surface above 800°C, in the presence of the hydrocarbons, results in the formation of an ordered carbonaceous overlayer with a diffraction pattern corresponding to a (9x9) surface structure. No indication for ordering of the carbonaceous residue was found on the stepped iridium surface in these experimental conditions. The hydrocarbon molecules form only poorly ordered surface structures on both iridium surfaces when the adsorption is carried out at 30°C. Benzene is the only gas that can be desorbed from the surfaces in large amounts by heating. Ethylene remains largely on the surface, only a few percent is removed by heating while acetylene and cyclohexane cannot be desorbed at all. When adsorption is carried out at 30°C and the crystal is subsequently flashed to high temperature, hydrogen is liberated from the surface. The hydrogen desorption spectra from the iridium surfaces exposed to C2H4, C2H2, or C6H6 exhibit two hydrogen desorption peaks, one around 200°C and the second around 350°C. The temperatures where these peaks appear vary slightly with the type of hydrocarbon. The relative intensities of these two peaks depend strongly on the surface used. Arguments are presented that decomposition of the hydrocarbon molecules (C-H bond breaking nd possibly also C-C bond breaking) occurs easier on the stepped iridium surface than on the (111) surface. Hydrogen is desorbed at a higher temperature from an iridium surface possessing a high density of surface imperfections than from a perfect iridium (111) surface. The results are compared with those obtained previously on similar crystal surfaces of platinum. It appears that C-H bond breaking occurs more easily on iridium than on platinum.},

	abstract = {1. Fragments of isolated rat liver plasma membrane possess a ribonuclease activity which at {pH} 7.8 in the presence of 10 {mM} {EDTA} can digest polyuridylic acid (poly(U)) and polycytidylic acid (poly(C)) but not polyadenylic acid (poly(A)) and polyguanylic acid (poly(G)). Under these conditions, the membrane preparation does not degrade native or denatured {DNA}. 2. The products of the reaction with poly(U) (10 {mM} {EDTA} present) can be separated on {DEAE}-Sephadex into oligonucleotides of increasing chain length. Most of the products are di- to hexa-nucleotides which contain terminal 3'-phosphate groups. 3. When {EDTA} is not present ({pH} 7.8 or 8.8) the plasma membrane preparation degrades both poly(A) and poly(U). With poly(A) the product is all nucleoside while with poly(U) as substrate most of the product is nucleoside, but also some oligonucleotides are produced. 4. The ribonuclease releases acid soluble products very slowly from high concentrations of poly(U) (mg/ml). 5. Uridine trinucleotide with and without a terminal 3'-phosphate group is degraded by rat liver plasma membrane. The trinucleotide diphosphate is rapidly hydrolyzed to nucleoside while the trinucleotide itself is slowly digested and yields intermediate products, including nucleoside.},

The deformation of H2-{TBPP} required to explain the {STM} images forms a pair of corresponding chiral conformations. The conformation determines which of the twin domains is formed. In contrast, porphyrin molecules with two tert-butyl-phenyl and two vinyl–phenyl groups (H2-{TBPVPP}) showed no form of ordered assembly due to the strong interaction between the vinyl–phenyl and substrate. {STM} observation showed that cis- and trans-H2-{TBPVPP} undergo different conformational changes, leading to mirror and two-fold symmetry, respectively.},

	abstract = {The primary interactions of low-energy x-rays within condensed matter, viz. photoabsorption and coherent scattering, have been described for photon energies outside the absorption threshold regions by using atomic scattering factors. The atomic scattering factors may be accurately determined from the atomic photoabsorption cross sections using modified Kramers-Kronig dispersion relations. From a synthesis of the currently available experimental data and recent theoretical calculations for photoabsorption, the angle-independent, forward-scattering components of the atomic scattering factors have been thus semiempirically determined and tabulated here for 92 elements and for the region 50-30,000 {eV}. Atomic scattering factors for all angles of coherent scattering and at the higher photon energies are obtained from these tabulated forward-scattering values by adding a simple angle-dependent form-factor correction. The incoherent scattering contributions that become significant for the light elements at the higher photon energies are similarly determined. The basic x-ray interaction relations that are used in applied x-ray physics are presented here in terms of the atomic scattering factors. The bulk optical constants are also related to the atomic scattering factors. These atomic and optical relations are applied to the detailed calculation of the reflectivity characteristics of a series of practical x-ray mirror, multilayer, and crystal monochromators. Comparisons of the results of this semiempirical, "atomic-like" description of x-ray interactions for the low-energy region with those of experiment and ab initio theory are presented.},

Electron spin resonance ({ESR}) analysis indicated a partially resolved five-line spectrum, suggesting that the label was attached to at least two different binding sites. Using specific blocking reagents prior to spin labeling, the two binding sites were attributed to the sulfhydryl group of beta-93 (immobile) and the alpha-amino group of the N-terminal valines (mobile). The relative motion of the spin at one set of binding sites was restricted regardless of the state of ligation and {pH}, while the motion at the other site showed dependence on those parameters, e.g. the spin-labeled N-terminal ends of deoxyhemoglobin have restricted motion at all {pH} ranges studied, while those of oxyhemoglobin are relatively free to move at the basic {pH} range, but become more restricted in the acidic {pH} range.},

This phenomenon can be described as geometrically analogous to lateral interference effects resulting in periodic moiré patterns which are characterized by two-dimensional moiré lattices. Here we discuss in detail the mathematical formalism determining such moiré patterns based on concepts of two-dimensional Fourier transformation including coincidence lattices. The formalism provides simple relations that allow one to calculate possible moiré lattice vectors in their dependence on rotation angles α and scaling factors p 1, p 2 for periodic ( p1 × p 2) R α overlayers on substrate surfaces described by general Bravais lattices. Specific emphasis will be given to hexagonal lattices where experimental data are available.},

	title = {Water Adsorption and Ion Induced Defect Formation: A Comparative Study of Graphene and Noble Metal Surfaces},
	url = {http://kups.ub.uni-koeln.de/5227/},
	abstract = {The thesis at hand is subdivided into parts. In the first part we study the thermodynamics and structure of water adsorption on graphene and noble metal surfaces. The second part of this thesis is dedicated to surface damage caused by grazing incidence ion bombardment of graphene on Ir(111). Both parts are completed by a comparison of the various sample systems. We study the structure and stability of the first water layer on Pt(111) by variable temperature scanning tunneling microscopy. Two structures observed previously by diffraction techniques are imaged for coverages at or close to completion of the wetting layer. At 140K only a (\${\textbackslash}sqrt\$37x\${\textbackslash}sqrt\$37)R25.3? superstructure can be established, while at 130K also a (\${\textbackslash}sqrt\$39x\${\textbackslash}sqrt\$39)R16.1? superstructure with slightly higher molecular density is formed. In the temperature range under concern the superstructures reversibly transform into each other by slight changes in coverage through adsorption or desorption. The superstructures exhibit a complex pattern of molecules in different geometries. We find that a high Pt step edge density considerably increases the long range order of the equilibrium superstructures, presumably due to the capability of step edges to trap residual adsorbates from the surface. Passivating the step edges with {CO} or preparing a flat metal surface leads to the formation of disordered structures, which still show the same structural elements as the ordered ones. Coadsorption of Xe and {CO} proves that the water layer covers the metal surface completely. Moreover, we determine the two-dimensional crystal structure of Xe on top of the chemisorbed water layer which exhibits a Xe-Xe distance close to the one in bulk Xe and a rotation angle of 90? between the close-packed directions of Xe and the close-packed directions of the underlying water layer. {CO} is shown to replace H2O on the Pt(111) surface as has been deduced previously. Finally, a so far not understood restructuring of the adlayer by an increased tunneling current has been observed. We present experimental data regarding the wetting behaviour and structure formation of water on Ir(111). Studying the thermodynamics of water adsorption and pointing out the possibility to form a wetting layer, we perform a coverage dependent analysis of the sub-monolayer regime. We show that water molecules form planar, polar clusters upon adsorption. A continuous water layer forms out of the cluster phase for {\textbackslash}ensuremath{\textbackslash}Theta{\textbackslash}ensuremath{\textgreater}0.5ML. The molecular arrangement is nearly identical to the wetting layer observed on Pt(111). The water growth mode changes from wetting to non-wetting for {\textbackslash}ensuremath{\textbackslash}Theta{\textbackslash}ensuremath{\textgreater}1ML as the closed water monolayer is hydrophobic. For both Pt(111) and Ir(111), we demonstrate that tunneling of electrons into the antibonding state or from the bonding state of H2O leads to dissociation of the molecules and a corresponding reordering of the adlayer into a (\${\textbackslash}sqrt\$3x\${\textbackslash}sqrt\$3)R30?-structure. An analogous study is carried out for water adsorption on a graphene covered Ir(111) surface. We show that water dewets graphene at 20K and forms three-dimensional, electronically insulating clusters aligned in the Gr?Ir(111) moiré for {\textbackslash}ensuremath{\textbackslash}Theta=3ML. Higher coverage results in coalescence and the formation of an amorphous adlayer. The occurence of this structure can be promoted by an increase of the adsorption temperature above 100K. By combining ion beam experiments and atomistic simulations we study the production of defects in graphene on Ir(111) under grazing incidence of low energy noble gas ions. Low fluences are chosen to make the damage patterns of individual ions visible. We demonstrate that the ions are channeled in between graphene and the substrate, giving rise to chains of vacancy clusters, and control the defect structure via tuning of the bombardment parameters. Combining our experiments on thermal stability of defects and density functional theory calculations, we discuss the atomic structure of defects in detail and show that their edges are bending down towards the substrate to saturate dangling bonds by the metal surface. With the onset of vacancy cluster mobility around 800K, the vacancies sense formation energy differences within the graphene moiré supercell, which paves the way towards the formation of a graphene nanomesh. In order to realize this struture a transition from isolated ion impacts towards a defect density in the magnitude of one per moiré cell has to be accomplished. We discuss the sample morphology and thermal evolution of the damage patterns following prolonged ion exposure. We show that the temperature during bombardment is of great importance to drive the carbon vacancies to these sites, where the formation energy is lowest, and thus allow for an immediate reconstruction of the graphene layer. Elaborating appropriate parameters for the formation of a high quality nanomesh regarding ion energy and fluence, we give an experimental realization of this structure.},

Flakes of less than 10 layers are prepared by mechanical cleavage and are thinned down to single layers in a high-energy electron beam. At our beam energies, we observe a highly selective sputtering of only one of the elements and predominantly at the exit surface of the specimen, and then subsequent removal of atoms next to a defect. Triangle-shaped holes appear in accordance with the crystallographic orientation of each layer. Defects are compared to those observed in graphene membranes. The observation of clean single-layer membranes shows that hexagonal boron nitride is a further material (in addition to graphene) that can exist in a quasi-two-dimensional allotrope without the need for a substrate.},

For comparison, the adsorption of atomic oxygen on highly oriented pyrolytic graphite has been studied under the same conditions. Graphene oxidation predominantly occurs through the formation of epoxy groups and causes atomic-scale buckling of the graphene lattice, as evidenced by an sp2-to-sp3 bonding transformation. The different parts of the graphene/metal moiré superstructure show different oxidation dynamics, with the initial formation of epoxy groups in the more bonding “pores”. Upon O adsorption, the nearest C neighbors of epoxy groups get engaged in a stronger bonding with the substrate. As a result, the pores of the graphene mesh become attracted and effectively pinned to the substrate by the O atoms. A limited intercalation of oxygen under graphene is also probable. Annealing of the samples after oxygen exposure only partially recovers the original graphene structure and results in the formation of a dense pattern of quasi-periodic, nanometer-sized holes. Both the selective oxidization and the hole formation can be exploited for selective functionalization or tuning of the electronic properties.},

	title = {Submonolayer growth of cobalt on metallic and insulating surfaces studied by scanning tunneling microscopy and kinetic Monte-Carlo simulations},
	abstract = {Submonolayer epitaxial growth is obtained by the deposition of less than a complete layer of atoms on a single crystal surface. It is of fundamental interest for industrial applications (e.g. in the semiconductor industry) as well as from the point of view of basic research. For example, it is known that nanometer-sized atomic structures (nanostructures) exhibit remarkable physical and chemical properties which can differ greatly from those of bulk matter. In order to investigate these properties, it is often necessary to create large quantities of well defined and possibly spatially ordered nanostructures. One way to achieve this result is self-organized growth where one deposits atoms on a clean crystalline surface and lets the growth process evolve freely. Here, nanostructures result from the atomic diffusion and aggregation processes taking place at the surface. Understanding the exact nature of these processes is of ongoing interest in the field of nanostructure growth. In this thesis we report about submonolayer growth experiments of the ferromagnetic transition metal cobalt. Cobalt was chosen because it exhibits remarkable magnetic properties. These experiments were performed in an ultra-high vacuum chamber and molecular beam epitaxy was used to grow the nanostructures. Observations of the surface were made using a variable-temperature scanning tunneling microscope ({STM}). In order to get a better understanding of the atomic processes happening at the surface, we developed two adapted computational simulation methods. Kinetic Monte-Carlo ({KMC}) simulations were used to get an atomistic picture of the surface while mean field rate equations were integrated numerically to yield cluster densities. We study the growth of cobalt on three different surfaces. By depositing Co on a clean Pt(111) crystal surface, we observe that the platinum surface reconstructs by forming star-shaped partial dislocations for sample temperatures above 180 K (-93Â°C). We also observe that island densities deviate from predictions of all known models towards higher values for these same temperatures. By simulation we are able to show that insertion of Co into the topmost platinum layer creates a repulsive network of dislocations. We show that these dislocations act as diffusion inhibiting barriers and thus influence the island density by constraining the free movement of atoms at the surface. We also show that the Co dimer and trimer diffuse on Pt(111) before dissociating and are able to extract corresponding activation barriers. We also study the deposition of Co on a Ru(0001) surface which shows a more conventional temperature dependence. By comparing simulation and experiment we extract all relevant diffusion activation barriers and show that at high temperatures the Co dimer and trimer dissociate. Finally, we investigate the growth of Co on the hexagonal boron nitride superlattice which forms on a Rh(111) surface. On this surface Co clusters form three-dimensional hemispherical dots. We show how the substrate corrugation influences diffusion of Co atoms and that clusters up to the size of the pentamer can diffuse. By simulation, we also extract the relevant migrations and desorption barriers.},

	abstract = {The localization of the previously postulated interface recognition site ({IRS}) in porcine pancreatic phospholipase A2, required for a specific interaction between the enzyme and organized lipid-water interfaces, was investigated by ultraviolet difference spectroscopy, by measurements of the intrinsic fluorescence of the unique Trp residue, and by protection experiments against specific tryptic hydrolysis. Using the enzymically nondegradable substrate analogues: {CnH}(2n+1)(0-){OOCH}2CH2N+({CH}3)3-(H,{OH}), it is shown that the rather hydrophobic N-terminal sequence of the enzyme, viz., Ala-Leu-Trp-Gln-Phe-Arg, is directly involved in the interaction with the lipid-water interface. Besides hydrophobic probably also polar interactions contribute to the binding process. At neutral or acidic {pH} the presence of a salt bridge between the N-terminal alpha-{NH}3+ group and a negatively charged side chain stablizes the interface recognition site and allows the enzyme to penetrate micellar surfaces, even in the absence of metal ion. At alkaline {pH}, interaction of the enzyme with micellar interfaces requires the presence of Ca2+ (Ba2+) ions.},

In this paper we address a number of conceptual questions that are often encountered when teaching capillarity. By answering these questions we provide a perspective that reconciles the macroscopic viewpoints, from thermodynamics or fluid mechanics, and the microscopic perspective from statistical physics.},

The variation, including the sign (decrease or increase) of the work functions as a result of {CO} adsorption, is identified to be due to the reversal or change in magnitude of the polarity of the molecule in the adsorbed state. The reversal of the ordering of the valence states according to this model becomes a natural consequence of the relaxation of the equilibrium internuclear distance. The systematics in the adsorption super-structures and the variation of other adsorption parameters especially that of adsorption energy are considered for both group {VIII} and Ib metals are The characteristics of the vibrational properties of adsorbed {CO} on group {VIII} and Ib metals are considered in terms of the electronic properties with a view to obtain possible correlations in the future. The need for more accurate measurements to evaluate the 5σ−1π separation in the adsorbed state is indicated, which will enable, it is hoped, a synthesis to be made of a unified correlation between internuclear distance, ν(C−O) and Δ(5σ−1π) within a single framework model. The characteristics of nitrogen (isoelectronic with {CO}) adsorption on group {VIII} metals are also considered for comparison.},

In earlier works the {WKB} approximation was used evaluating the transmission coefficient and therefore only the barrier between the classical turning points was considered. The {WKB} transmission coefficient of a trapezoidal potential barrier is a monotonically decreasing function of applied voltage. In the present paper the exact treatment of the whole barrier shows that the transmission coefficient D(V) can be a function with superposed periodic oscillations. These oscillations are caused by partial reflection and interference of electron waves in the part of the trapezoidal barrier, where the potential energy is less than the kinetic energy of the electron. Also the calculated tunnel current I(V) can have a noticeable superposed oscillation. For observing this oscillation in metal-insulator-metal films the conditions are large electron mean free path (probable some hundred {AE}) in the dielectric layer and specular reflection from the barrier boundaries.},

The results are compared with those for the Au/Rh(1\&\#xa0;1\&\#xa0;1) and Au/h-{BN}/Pt(1\&\#xa0;1\&\#xa0;1) interfaces. It has been found that on clean Rh(1\&\#xa0;1\&\#xa0;1) substrate gold starts to grow two-dimensionally (2D), while in the presence of a h-{BN} interlayer it forms islands from the very beginning. In the case of flat h-{BN} monolayer (on Pt) these islands are essentially three-dimensional (3D) and irregular in size. In contrast, on the h-{BN} nanomesh (on Rh) gold grows initially as regular islands (predominantly 2D), probably filling the pores of the nanomesh. In addition, the evolution of the Au islands in h-{BN}/Rh(1\&\#xa0;1\&\#xa0;1) upon annealing has been investigated with core level photoemission and X-ray absorption. The annealing at temperatures between {RT} and 300\&\#xa0;°C does not affect the 2D character of Au islands, while further increase in temperature results in formation of 3D islands. At higher temperatures (above 500\&\#xa0;°C), the gold atoms diffuse through h-{BN} into the Rh substrate and/or desorb from the surface. However, they do not influence the chemical bond between rhodium and h-{BN} at any stage of annealing: the nanomesh remains intact.},

The requirements for the growth of low-dimensional adsorbate structures at step edges of the vicinal (997) and (779) surfaces of platinum will be discussed in detail. Here energetics determined by the different adsorption sites and the kinetics present through the diffusion processes play an essential role. In order to obtain stable arrangements the propensity of the elements for alloy formation must be taken into account. Examples for the properties of the structures obtained and their role in studying one-dimensional systems are discussed, and we give a short outlook on how the principles of step decoration might be extended to a kind of atomic assembly of more complex surface nanostructures.},

	abstract = {The growth of thin {NaCl} layers at room temperature on a Ag(100) and a Ag(1, 1, 19) substrate has been investigated by {LEED} spot profile analysis, supplemented by {EELS} in order to clarify the electronic structure of the film. Our {LEED} analysis of {NaCl}/Ag(100) shows that the average orientation of the {NaCl} unit mesh is the same as that of the Ag substrate, but rotational mosaics are formed in the (100) plane. The angular distribution of rotational angles has a width of +/-9degrees around the average direction. From this result we conclude that the direction of the substrate step edges determines the orientation of the {NaCl} islands. The steps of the vicinal silver surface are overgrown by elastic {NaCl} carpets. With increasing coverage, the modulation of the {NaCl} films by the step structure gets more and more washed out until, at around 10 {ML}, the whole film is only tilted by the nominal miscut of the sample. Closed films are only found at a thickness larger than 4 {ML}, as concluded from {EELS}.},

Thin films were prepared by organic molecular beam epitaxy and subsequent annealing. Our systematic study provides an understanding of the changes of the spectroscopic signature during adsorption and metalation. Specifically, we achieved a detailed peak assignment of the 2H-{TPP} multilayer data of the C1s and the N1s region. After annealing to 420 K both {XPS} and {NEXAFS} show the signatures of a metalloporphyrin, which indicates self-metalation at the porphyrin-substrate interface, resulting in Cu-{TPP}. Furthermore, for 2H-{TPP} monolayer samples we show how the strong influence of the copper surface is reflected in the spectroscopic signatures. Adsorption results in a strongly deformed macrocycle and a quenching of the first {NEXAFS} resonance in the nitrogen edge suggesting electron transfer into the {LUMO}. For Cu-{TPP} the spectroscopic data indicate a reduced interaction of first-layer molecules with the substrate as demonstrated by the relaxed macrocycle geometry.},

	abstract = {We present a scanning tunneling microscope study on reactivity of chemisorbed oxygen on the Cu(110)–(2 × 1)–O surface. We have found that the Cu(110)–(2 × 1)–O surface is intrinsically unstable under thermal annealing in the 400–900 K range. In the 455–570 K range, the surface undergoes faceting. The orientational transition of the adsorbed oxygen phase displays wide [110] terraces, covered by (2 × 1)–O bands self-assembled into a superstructure, as well as bunches of oxygen-free narrow terraces. We found that the wide [110] terraces are intrinsically unstable against further restructuring at their edges. The restructuration is driven by reversible thermal dissociation of the (2 × 1)–O bands. The slightly uneven oxygen band density between terraces, consequently differing in reactivity with respect to Cu–O fragments, induces Cu atom transport between their edges. The interplay between thermal dissociation of the (2 × 1)–O bands and long-range elastic relaxation of the strained surface is suggested to be the origin of the observed inhomogeneous oxygen distribution. In the 570–810 K range the Cu atom transport reveals continuous growth of the oxygenated [110] terraces. We discuss in detail the mechanism of the Cu transport, which results in a rapid propagation of the oxygenated terraces as well as a strain development on the surface.},

	abstract = {Purified skeletal muscle myosin ({EC} 3.6.1.3) has been covalently bound to Sepharose 4B by the cyanogen bromide procedure. The resulting complex, Sepharose-Myosin, possesses adenosine triphosphatase activity and is relatively stable for long periods of time. Under optimal binding conditions, approximately 33\% of the specific {ATPase} activity of the bound myosin is retained. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of polypeptides released from denatured Sepharose-Myosin indicates that 85\% of the myosin is attached to the agarose beads through the heavy chains and the remainder through the light chains, in agreement with predictions of binding and release based upon either the lysine contents or molecular weights of themyosin subunits. The adenosine triphosphatase of the immobilized myosin has been investigated under conditions of varying {pH}, ionic strength, and cation concentration. The {ATPase} profiles of immobilized myosin are quite similar to those for free myosin, however subtle differences are found. The Sepharose-Myosin {ATPase} is not as sensitive as myosin to alterations in salt concentration and the apparent {KM} is approximately two-fold higher than that of myosin. These differences are probably due to chemical modification in the region of the attachment site(s) to the agarose beads and hydration and diffusion limitations imposed by the polymeric agarose matrix.},

Previous studies relate the energy shift between peaks of the lowest-order Gundlach oscillation observed on the thin film and the metal substrate to the difference in their work functions. By observing Gundlach oscillations on Ag/Au(111), Ag/Cu(111), and Co/Cu(111) systems, we demonstrate that the work function difference is not the energy shift of the lowest order but the ones of higher order where a constant energy shift exhibits. Higher order Gundlach oscillations can thus be applied to determine the work function of thin metal films precisely.},

Strain energies are found to be smaller for {BN} nanotubes than for carbon nanotubes of the same radius, owing to a buckling effect which stabilizes the {BN} tubular structure. For tubes larger than 9.5 Å in diameter, the lowest conduction band is predicted to be free-electron-like with electronic charge density localized inside the tube. For these tubes, this band is at constant energy above the top of the valence band. Consequently, contrarily to carbon nanotubes, single- and multi-wall {BN} nanotubes are constant-band-gap materials, independent of their radius and helicity. In addition, we expect them to exhibit remarkable properties under n -type doping.},

	abstract = {The reaction of glutamate dehydrogenase and glutamate (gl) with {NAD}+ and {NADP}+ has been studied with stopped-flow techniques. The enzyme was in all experiments present in excess of the coenzyme. The results indicate that the ternary complex (E-{NAD}(P)H-kg) is present as an intermediate in the formation of the stable complex (E-{NAD}(P)H-gl). The identification of the complexes is based on their absorption spectra. The binding of the coenzyme to (E-gl) is the rate-limiting step in the formation of (E-{NAD}(P)H-kg) while the dissociation of alpha-ketoglutarate (kg) from this complex is the rate-limiting step in the formation of (E-{NAD}(P)H-gl). The Km for glutamate was 20-25 {mM} in the first reaction and 3 {mM} in the formation of the stable complex. The Km values were independent of the coenzyme. The reaction rates with {NAD}+ were approximately 50\% greater than those with {NADP}+. Furthermore, high glutamate concentration inhibited the formation of (E-{NADH}-kg) while no substrate inhibition was found with {NADP}+ as coenzyme. {ADP} enhanced while {GTP} reduced the rate of (E-{NAD}(P)H-gl) formation. The rate of formation of (E-{NAD}(P)H-kg) was inhibited by {ADP}, while it increased at high glutamate concentration when small amounts of {GTP} were added. The results show that the higher activity found with {NAD}+ compared to {NADP}+ under steady-state assay conditions do not necessarily involve binding of {NAD}+ to the {ADP} activating site of the enzyme. Moreover, the substrate inhibition found at high glutamate concentration under steady-state assay condition is not due to the formation of (E-{NAD}(P)H-gl) as this complex is formed with Km of 3 {mM} glutamate, and the substrate inhibition is only significant at 20-30 times this concentration.},

	abstract = {Protease activity was detected in membranes of human bovine erythrocytes prepared by the conventional procedures which include washing and removal of the "buffy layer". The enzyme was extracted by 0.75 M {KCNS} or ({NH}4)2SO4 and was activated by 0.4 to 0.5 M of the same salts. Colored, particulate hide powder-azure, membrane fractions and soluble proteins such as hemoglobin, casein or albumin were susceptible to hydrolysis by the membraneous protease. Partial purification of the enzyme was accomplished through disc-gel electrophoresis on polyacrylamide in the presence of 0.25\% positively charged detergents like cetyltrimethylammonium bromide. An alkaline protease ({pH} 7.4) with properties similar to those of the erythrocyte enzyme was found in leucocytes. The similarity between the properties of the leucocytic and erythrocytic proteases and the correlation of the activity in erythrocyte membranes with content of white cells in these preparations, suggest that enzymatic activities in the contaminating leucocytes are responsible for the activity of membraneous proteases in erythrocytes.},

At 200 K, controlled {STM} tip-induced unidirectional switching is possible, yielding an information storage density of 4.9 ? 1013 bit/inch2.

	doi = {10.1016/j.surfrep.2007.06.001},
	shorttitle = {Beyond the surface atlas},
	abstract = {Throughout the development of single-crystal surface science, interest has predominantly focussed on the high-symmetry planes of crystalline materials, which typically present simple stable structures with small primitive unit cells. This concentration of effort has rapidly and substantially advanced our understanding of fundamental surface phenomena, and provides a sound basis for detailed study of more complex planes. The intense current interest in these is partly motivated by their regular arrays of steps, kinks or other low-coordination structural features, whose properties are little understood and may mimic specific highly-reactive sites on dispersed nanoparticles. Furthermore, the lower symmetry of these planes may give rise to other equally interesting properties such as intrinsic chirality, with exciting potential applications in enantioselective heterogeneous catalysis, biosensors and surface magnetism. To aid exploration of this new territory for surface science requires a depth of understanding that goes beyond the character of individual surfaces to encompass the global relationships between all possible surfaces of a given material, both in their structure and in their symmetry. In this report we present a rigorous conceptual framework for ideal crystalline surfaces within which the symmetry and structure of all possible surface orientations are described. We illustrate the versatility of our generally-applicable approach by comparing fcc, bcc and hcp materials. The entire scheme naturally derives from the very simple basis that the fundamental distinction between symmetry and structure is paramount. Where symmetry is concerned, our approach recognises that the surface is not a two-dimensional (21)) object but actually a truncated three-dimensional (3D) one. We therefore derive a symmetry scheme specifically formulated for surfaces and naturally encompassing their chirality where necessary. Our treatment of surface structure, on the other hand, highlights elementary one-dimensional ({ID}) features lying parallel to the surface plane. Crucial to the utility of these concepts is that both structure and symmetry can conveniently be represented independently within a single stereographic projection; this then serves as a "roadmap" that fully embodies the essential relationships between different surfaces and facilitates navigation amongst them. Key locations on the map identify surfaces of particular structural simplicity, which are collated in a gazetteer" with an accompanying description of their essential symmetry and structural character. Our symmetry-structure surface stereography (4S) analysis of fcc, bcc and hcp crystals reveals various new insights about the types of surface that they present. For instance, although the asymmetry of chiral fcc planes has hitherto been associated with the presence of kink sites, we show that the same is not always true of either bcc or hcp chiral surfaces. Kink-free chiral bcc planes offer particular advantages as model systems for asymmetric applications. We further reveal that the hcp crystal structure gives rise to intriguing types of surface that are not observed for either ficc or bcc materials. These include surfaces with intrinsic glide symmetry, surfaces with intrinsic racemic character and others displaying intrinsic double-chirality, analogous to the existence of diastereoisomers in molecular chemistry. We also identify several elementary surface structural categories that are specific to the hcp case. Having thus established a secure framework via ideal bulk-terminated crystalline surfaces, we subsequently demonstrate its extension to real surfaces. In considering how these differ from ideal surfaces we discuss relaxation and reconstruction within the same symmetry-resolved and structure-resolved perspective, drawing on numerous examples from the literature. Finally we illustrate the application of our scheme in one selected branch of surface science by exploring the symmetry-constraints on the surface chemistry of chiral molecules at chiral substrates.

The results show that, for Cu, Ag, Ni, Al, Pb and Ir, the average values of the surface energies are very close to the polycrystalline experimental data. For all fcc metals, as predicted, the close-packed (111) surface has the lowest surface energy. The surface energies for the other surfaces increase linearly with increasing angle between the surfaces ( hkl ) and (111). This can be used to estimate the relative values of the surface energy.},

To examine these fundamental issues we have performed molecular dynamics simulations to record the stress–strain curves in tensile tests and measure Young's modulus, fracture strength and fracture strain in armchair and zigzag directions. Comparing the results obtained at different temperatures and strain rates we have quantified the effects of the two factors on the tensile properties of the h-{BN} nanosheets. The influence of crystal orientation is also examined in the present study. It is found that the h-{BN} nanosheets are basically an anisotropic material whose tensile properties vary substantially with temperature and strain rate. In particular, a yielding platform is observed for the h-{BN} nanomaterial at relatively low temperature.},

We investigate whether such reference varies for photoemitted electrons in nanometer-sized systems that expose different crystal planes. To this aim, we exploit the structural tunability of the Ag/Cu(223) system which is capable of offering surfaces with periodic arrays of nanofacets of varying size and orientation. A thorough, photon-energy-dependent analysis of the surface states confined to such nanostructures is performed comparing different reference planes for photoemitted electrons. Assuming the premise that k({\textbar}{\textbar}) must be a good quantum number for 2D states, we conclude that the (final state) photoelectron reference direction is not the average optical direction but the local facet that confines the (initial state) surface electrons. Moreover, in the general case of nanostructured systems with uneven surfaces, we show how the photoelectron reference plane can be empirically determined through such a photon-energy-dependent {ARPES} analysis.},

Cluster stability and adsorption-induced processes were analyzed as a function of cluster size, with in situ scanning tunneling microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Small clusters containing fewer than 10 atoms were unstable upon {CO} adsorption. They sintered through Smoluchowski ripening—cluster diffusion and coalescence—rather than the frequently reported Ostwald ripening mediated by metal–adsorbate complexes. Larger clusters remained immobile upon {CO} adsorption but became more three-dimensional.

There has already been some research on manipulating individual sheets on {HOPG} surfaces with scanning probe microscope tips; such sheets were obtained either accidentally or with a less controllable indenting technique. Here we present a different approach, which is more reliable and controllable. The {HOPG} surface was first patterned to create an array of small graphite islands by reactive ion etching of the {HOPG} surface with an oxygen plasma. These islands were then manipulated with an atomic force microscope tip. Carbon nanotubes represent a promising material for nanotechnology and can be considered as a graphene sheet rolled into a seamless cylinder. While carbon nanotubes are synthesized successfully with laser ablation, carbon arc, or chemical vapour deposition techniques, we speculate that it might be possible, by the controlled fabrication of graphene sheets, to form nanotubes or other novel motifs of use for nanotechnology.},

	abstract = {From an interplay between variable temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and density–functional theory calculations, the evolution of oxygen chemisorption-induced surface reconstructions of the Cu(110) surface is determined. The surface reconstructions proceed via a sequential pathway with increasing oxygen surface coverage. The (2 × 1) reconstruction occurs first and then transits to the c(6 × 2) phase with a higher oxygen coverage through a mechanism that consumes the existing (2 × 1) phase with the supply of Cu adatoms from step edges and terraces. The temperature dependence of the (2 × 1) → c(6 × 2) transition demonstrates that the surface phase transition is an activated process for breaking up added Cu–O–Cu rows in the (2 × 1) structure. Comparison between the experimental observations and the theoretical surface phase diagram obtained from first-principles thermodynamic calculations reveals that the (2 × 1) → c(6 × 2) transition takes place at the oxygen chemical potentials that are far above the chemical potential for Cu2O bulk oxide formation, reflecting the existence of kinetic limitations to the surface phase transition and the bulk oxide formation.},

	abstract = {Using molecular dynamics, nudged elastic band and modified analytic embedded atom methods, the self-diffusion dynamics properties of palladium atomic clusters up to seven atoms on the Pd (1 1 1) surface have been studied at temperatures ranging from 300 to 1000 K. The simulation time varies from 20 to 75 ns according to the cluster sizes and the temperature ranges. The heptamer and trimer are more stable than the other neighboring clusters. The diffusion coefficients of the clusters are derived from the mean square displacement of the cluster's mass-center, and the diffusion prefactors D 0 and activation energies E a are derived from the Arrhenius relation. The activation energy of the clusters increases with the increasing atom number in the clusters, especially for Pd 6 to Pd 7 . The analysis of trajectories shows the noncompact clusters diffuse by the local diffusion mechanism but the compact clusters diffuse mainly by the whole gliding mechanism, and some static energy barriers of the diffusion modes are calculated. From Pd 2 to Pd 6 , the prefactors are in the range of the standard value 10 −3 cm 2 s −1 , and the prefactor of Pd 7 cluster is 2 orders of magnitude greater than that of the single Pd adatom because of a large number of nonequivalent diffusion processes. The heptamer can be the nucleus in the room temperature range according to nucleation theory.},

	abstract = {The adsorption of {CO} on Cu(111) has been re-investigated using Fourier transform reflection absorption infrared spectroscopy ({FT}-{RAIRS}), electron energy loss spectroscopy ({EELS}) and low energy electron diffraction ({LEED}). The combination of these techniques has revealed important new information about this system. At 95 K three adsorption stages (1 to 3) can be distinguished, leading to successive ordered overlayer structures (I to {III}). Stage 1 exists for coverages up to 0.33 and involves linearly bound species only. The sharpest band observed during the course of these experiments, with an intrinsic {FWHM} of 4.5 cm−1, is associated with a coverage of 0.33 and an ordered (√3 × √3)R30 ° structure (I). Stage 2 is associated with the coverage regime 0.33−0.44. In this stage {EELS} data show tilted, linear {CO} species are present. No bridged species exist at this point. On the basis of this, we propose a new overlayer structure ({II}), for θ = 0.44. Increasing the coverage gives stage 3. During this process, the high resolution {FT}-{RAIRS} spectra resolved two bands associated with linear {CO} species. The behaviour of these bands suggests that the final structure ({III}) is formed in a step-wise manner, with islands of ({II}) and ({III}) coexisting in the adlayer. Both linear and bridged species exist in stage 3. The bandshapes suggest significant inhomogeneities in the adlayer are present at the saturation coverage. Finally, the concentration of bridged species is found to be very sensitive to the adsorption temperature.},

	abstract = {Molecular dynamic simulations are performed to investigate the mechanical properties of hybrid graphene and hexagonal boron nitrogen (h-{BN}) sheet with the concentration of {BN} ranging from 0\% to 100\%. We find that Young's modulus of the hybrid sheet decreases with increasing concentration of {BN}, irrespective of {BN} shapes and distributions. However, a little mixing of h-{BN} and graphene can result in a noticeable drop in the yield strength of the hybrid sheet. In addition, the hybrid sheet exhibits strong plasticity behaviour during the tensile loading, which is not observed in pure graphene and {BN} sheets. We further demonstrate that this behaviour can be interpreted by the fact that the interface between the {BN} domain and graphene governs the failure mechanism of the hybrid sheet, which can be approximated by the classical Griffith model. Our results suggest that the mechanical properties of the hybrid graphene–{BN} sheet should be considered carefully when evaluating its whole performance when it is used in bandgap-engineered applications such as electronics and optics.},

Cu(2 1 1) is a vicinal surface with (1 1 1) terraces and intrinsic (1 0 0) steps (step distance 6.25 Å). This starting surface restructures upon {NaCl} deposition when the growth temperature exceeds ∼270 K. The initially flat surface is transformed into a periodic one-dimensional hill-and-valley structure consisting of (3 1 1) and (1 1 1) facets. {NaCl} grows selectively on (3 1 1) facets only, thereby creating a regular surface pattern with alternating stripes of bare Cu and chemically inert {NaCl}-covered areas. The lateral stripe spacing can be varied from ∼30 Å at 300 K to ∼230 Å at 600 K via the growth/annealing temperature. The present restructuring process is governed by the interplay between energetics and kinetics, namely by (1) the tendency to form (1 0 0)-terminated {NaCl} layers, (2) energetically favored interfacial matching between {NaCl}(1 0 0) and Cu(3 1 1), and (3) sufficient mobility of the substrate surface to allow for Cu mass transport.},

	abstract = {We perform ab initio calculations that indicate that the relative stability of antiphase boundaries ({APBs}) with armchair and zigzag chiralities in monolayer boron nitride ({BN}) is strongly dependent on the chemical potentials of boron (B) and nitrogen (N) in the synthesis process. For a realistic interval of chemical potentials, ranging from gas-phase to solid-state sources, a stoichiometric armchair {APB} with tetragons and octagons in its core and no homopolar bonds (N–N or B–B) is found to be the most stable in the intrinsic region of the chemical-potential interval, while for N-rich (B-rich) environments a zigzag-oriented boundary with a core consisting of hexagons only, containing N–N (B–B) bonds is found to be the most stable. Zigzag boundaries with core structures consisting of pentagons and octagons, containing homopolar bonds, are also considered in both undoped and carbon-doped forms. We find that at the typical temperatures of {BN}–nanostructure synthesis several of these zigzag boundaries should coexist with the armchair one, under N-rich or B-rich conditions. This stability transition arises from a competition between homopolar-bond and elastic-energy costs in the core of the {APBs}, in contrast with the case of graphene, where the zigzag geometry with pentagons and octagons is the most stable. We also address the stability of N- and B-terminated edges of {BN} triangular islands and find a robust stability for N-terminated edges, across a wide range of chemical potential values, in agreement with the experimentally observed tendency of {BN} islands to display N-terminated zigzag edges. We predict that fine-tuning the chemical potentials with a B-rich source where B atoms are in a bonding environment of low stability may lead to the formation of B-terminated zigzag edges. The electronic structure of the two types of {APBs} in {BN} is shown to be particularly distinct, with the zigzag {APB} depicting defect-like deep electronic bands in the band gap, while the armchair {APB} shows bulk-like shallow electronic bands.},

	abstract = {Graphene and hexagonal boron nitride (h-{BN}) have similar crystal structures with a lattice constant difference of only 2\%. However, graphene is a zero-bandgap semiconductor with remarkably high carrier mobility at room temperature1, 2, 3, whereas an atomically thin layer of h-{BN}4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 is a dielectric with a wide bandgap of 5.9 {eV}. Accordingly, if precise two-dimensional domains of graphene and h-{BN} can be seamlessly stitched together, hybrid atomic layers with interesting electronic applications could be created10. Here, we show that planar graphene/h-{BN} heterostructures can be formed by growing graphene in lithographically patterned h-{BN} atomic layers. Our approach can create periodic arrangements of domains with size ranging from tens of nanometres to millimetres. The resulting graphene/h-{BN} atomic layers can be peeled off the growth substrate and transferred to various platforms including flexible substrates. We also show that the technique can be used to fabricate two-dimensional devices, such as a split closed-loop resonator that works as a bandpass filter.},

Although recent advances in chemical vapour deposition methods have enabled the large-scale production of both intrinsic and doped graphene, as well as hexagonal boron nitride (h-{BN}), controlled fabrication of lateral heterostructures in these truly atomically thin systems has not been achieved. Graphene/h-{BN} interfaces are of particular interest, because it is known that areas of different atomic compositions may coexist within continuous atomically thin films and that, with proper control, the bandgap and magnetic properties can be precisely engineered. However, previously reported approaches for controlling these interfaces have fundamental limitations and cannot be easily integrated with conventional lithography. Here we report a versatile and scalable process, which we call 'patterned regrowth', that allows for the spatially controlled},

Herein, we report the large-scale synthesis of high-quality h-{BN} nanosheets in a chemical vapor deposition ({CVD}) process by controlling the surface morphologies of the copper (Cu) catalysts. It was found that morphology control of the Cu foil is much critical for the formation of the pure h-{BN} nanosheets as well as the improvement of their crystallinity. For the first time, we demonstrate the performance enhancement of {CVD}-based graphene devices with large-scale h-{BN} nanosheets. The mobility of the graphene device on the h-{BN} nanosheets was increased 3 times compared to that without the h-{BN} nanosheets. The on?off ratio of the drain current is 2 times higher than that of the graphene device without h-{BN}. This work suggests that high-quality h-{BN} nanosheets based on {CVD} are very promising for high-performance large-area graphene electronics.},

Similar to the structure of graphene, two-dimensional semiconductors are its two-dimensional and isostructural counterparts based on the typical layer-structured semiconductors, such as boron nitride (h-{BN}) and transition metal dichalcogenides (e.g. {MoS}2 and {WS}2), whose layers are bound by weak van der Waals forces. Unlike the semi-metal features of graphene, the two-dimensional semiconductors are natural semiconductors with thicknesses on the atomic scale. When one of the dimensions is extremely reduced, the two-dimensional semiconductors exhibit some unique properties, such as a transition from indirect to direct semiconductor properties, and hence have great potential for applications in electronics, energy storage, sensors, catalysis and composites, which arise both from the dimension-reduced effect and from the modified electronic structure. In this feature article, recent developments in the synthesis, properties and applications of two-dimensional semiconductors are discussed. The reported virtues and novelties of two-dimensional semiconductors are highlighted and the current problems in their developing process are clarified, in addition to their challenges and future prospects.},

The temperature- and exposure-dependent growth of graphene is investigated in detail by scanning tunneling microscopy. {TPG} is found to yield compact graphene islands bounded by C zigzag edges. The island size may be tuned from a few to a couple of tens of nanometers through Smoluchowski ripening. In the {CVD} growth, the carbon in ethene molecules arriving on the Ir surface is found to convert with probability near unity to graphene. The temperature-dependent nucleation, interaction with steps and coalescence of graphene islands are analyzed and a consistent model for {CVD} growth is developed.},

However, the theoretical values above 2000 K are considered to be tentative because of the poor quality of the experimental thermal expansion data in this region. Selected values of the thermal expansion coefficient and measurements of length change due to thermal expansion have been used to calculate the variation with temperature of the lattice parameter, interatomic distance, atomic and molar volumes, and density. This data is presented in the Tables. Comparison of the data available in the literature with the selected values presented in this paper is shown in the Figures. The density of iridium at 293.15 K (\$20{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ\$C) is 22.562 kg m{\textless}sup xmlns=\#http://pub2web.metastore.ingenta.com/ns/\#{\textgreater}\&\#8211;3{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}.},

	abstract = {Suitable templates to steer the formation of nanostructure arrays on surfaces are indispensable in nanoscience. Recently, atomically thin sp2-bonded layers such as graphene or boron nitride ({BN}) grown on metal supports have attracted considerable interest due to their potential geometric corrugation guiding the positioning of atoms, metallic clusters or molecules. Here, we demonstrate three specific functions of a geometrically smooth, but electronically corrugated, sp2/metal interface, namely, {BN}/Cu(111), qualifying it as a unique nanoscale template. As functional adsorbates we employed free-base porphine (2H?P), a prototype tetrapyrrole compound, and tetracyanoquinodimethane ({TCNQ}), a well-known electron acceptor. (i) The electronic moirons of the {BN}/Cu(111) interface trap both 2H?P and {TCNQ}, steering self-organized growth of arrays with extended molecular assemblies. (ii) We report an effective decoupling of the trapped molecules from the underlying metal support by the {BN}, which allows for a direct visualization of frontier orbitals by scanning tunneling microscopy ({STM}). (iii) The lateral molecular positioning in the superstructured surface determines the energetic level alignment; i.e., the energy of the frontier orbitals, and the electronic gap are tunable.},

Thin films were prepared by organic molecular beam epitaxy and subsequent annealing. Our systematic study provides an understanding of the changes of the spectroscopic signature during adsorption and metalation. Specifically, we achieved a detailed peak assignment of the 2H-{TPP} multilayer data of the C1s and the N1s region. After annealing to 420 K both {XPS} and {NEXAFS} show the signatures of a metalloporphyrin, which indicates self-metalation at the porphyrin-substrate interface, resulting in Cu-{TPP}. Furthermore, for 2H-{TPP} monolayer samples we show how the strong influence of the copper surface is reflected in the spectroscopic signatures. Adsorption results in a strongly deformed macrocycle and a quenching of the first {NEXAFS} resonance in the nitrogen edge suggesting electron transfer into the {LUMO}. For Cu-{TPP} the spectroscopic data indicate a reduced interaction of first-layer molecules with the substrate as demonstrated by the relaxed macrocycle geometry.},

It is found that the asymmetry of nanoribbon edges causes a uniform curvature of the ribbons due to structural stress in the aromatic ring plane. Narrow graphene nanoribbons terminated with fluorine on one side demonstrate a considerable out-of-plane bend, suggesting that the nanoribbon is a fraction of a conical surface. It is shown that the intrinsic curvature of the narrow nanoribbons destroys the periodicity and results in a systematic cancellation of the dipole moment. The in- and out-of-plane curvature of thin arcs allows their closure in nanorings or cone fragments of giant diameter. Using the fragment molecular orbital method, we optimized the structure of a planar giant arc and a closed ring of h-{BN} with a diameter of 105 nm.},

The strength of interfacial chemical interaction between h-{BN} and the substrates is rising in the row Pt(1\&\#xa0;1\&\#xa0;1)–Ir(1\&\#xa0;1\&\#xa0;1)–Rh(1\&\#xa0;1\&\#xa0;1)–Ru(0\&\#xa0;0\&\#xa0;0\&\#xa0;1). This rise directly correlates with a growing corrugation of the h-{BN} monolayer. In particular, the h-{BN} nanomesh has larger pores on Ru(0\&\#xa0;0\&\#xa0;0\&\#xa0;1) than on the less reactive Rh(1\&\#xa0;1\&\#xa0;1) substrate. Our experiments provide strong evidence for the single-layer model of the nanomesh structure.},

	abstract = {Graphdiyne, consisting of sp- and sp2-hybridized carbon atoms, is a new member of carbon allotropes which has a natural band gap ∼1.0 {eV}. Here, we report our first-principles calculations on the stable configurations and electronic structures of graphdiyne doped with boron–nitrogen ({BN}) units. We show that {BN} unit prefers to replace the sp-hybridized carbon atoms in the chain at a low doping rate, forming linear {BN} atomic chains between carbon hexagons. At a high doping rate, {BN} units replace first the carbon atoms in the hexagons and then those in the chains. A comparison study indicates that these substitution reactions may be easier to occur than those on graphene which composes purely of sp2-hybridized carbon atoms. With the increase of {BN} component, the band gap increases first gradually and then abruptly, corresponding to the transition between the two substitution motifs. The direct-band gap feature is intact in these {BN}-doped graphdiyne regardless the doping rate. A simple tight-binding model is proposed to interpret the origin of the band gap opening behaviors. Such wide-range band gap modification in graphdiyne may find applications in nanoscaled electronic devices and solar cells.},

Ajayan et al. on Cu foils because of their unusual electronic properties ( Ci, L. J.; et al. Nat. Mater. 2010, 9, 430 − 435 ). However, many fundamental issues are still not clear, including the in-plane atomic continuity as well as the edge type at the boundary of hybridized h-{BN} and graphene domains. To clarify these issues, we have successfully grown a perfect single-layer h-{BN}-graphene ({BNC}) patchwork on a selected Rh(111) substrate, via a two-step patching growth approach. With the ideal sample, we convinced that at the in-plane linking interface, graphene and h-{BN} can be linked perfectly at an atomic scale. More importantly, we found that zigzag linking edges were preferably formed, as demonstrated by atomic-scale scanning tunneling microscopy images, which was also theoretically verified using density functional theory calculations. We believe the experimental and theoretical works are of particular importance to obtain a fundamental understanding of the {BNC} hybrid and to establish a deliberate structural control targeting high-performance electronic and spintronic devices.},

A minimum molecular weight of 24000 +/- 1500 per heme group was determined from the iron and heme contents, 0.22 +/- 0.01 and 2.73 +/- 0.14 weight \%, respectively. The subunit composition of the erythrocruorin was investigated using gel filtration in sodium dodecyl sulfate and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate at neutral {pH}. Haemopis erythrocruorin dissociated in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate into four subunits (1 through 4) possessing molecular weights of about 27000, 23000, 21000 and 13500, respectively. When the erythrocruorin was reduced with mercaptoethanol prior to sodium dodecyl sulfate electrophoresis, three subunits were observed, possessing molecular weights of about 13000 (I), 16500 ({II}) and 28000 ({III}). Sodium dodecyl sulfate electrophoresis of the isolated subunits 1 through 4 showed that subunit I was provided by subunits 1 and 4, subunit {II} was provided by subunit 1 and subunit {III} was provided by both subunit 2 and subunit 3. Haemopis erythrocruorin thus appeared to consist of at least five different polypeptide chains. It is likely that not all of the constituent polypeptide chains were associated each with a heme group. The shape of the Haemopis erythrocruorin observed by electron microscopy appeared to be consistent with the two-tiered hexagonal array characteristic of annelid erythrocruorins and chlorocruorins.},

	title = {Interaction of Graphene and Templated Cluster Arrays with {CO}, H2, and O2},
	url = {http://kups.ub.uni-koeln.de/5159/},
	abstract = {Interaction of graphene and templated cluster arrays with {CO}, H2 and O2 was studied by means of scanning tunneling microscopy ({STM}) and X-ray photoemission spectroscopy ({XPS}). The experimental data was complemented by ab initio density functional theory ({DFT}) calculations. As a prerequisite for studies of gas interaction, the binding mechanism of the clusters to graphene, as well as the growth and structure of Pt clusters, was investigated in detail. The formation of cluster lattices on graphene on Ir(111) has been explained by graphene rehybridization. This {DFT} picture was tested by comparing calculated core level spectra to {XPS} measurements. For pristine graphene, {DFT} and {XPS} agree on a 140 {meV} modulation of the C 1s core level shifts ({CLS}), which correlates with the height modulation of the graphene layer above the Ir surface. With Pt clusters adsorbed, measured Pt 4f {CLS} of the adsorbed clusters also support the calculations. The modulation of the C 1s spectrum is strengthened with clusters adsorbed, and C atoms both under and in the vicinity of the Pt clusters are experimentally distinguished as a broad shoulder of positive C 1s {CLS}. The calculations suggest that the sp2 to sp3 rehybridization of graphene displaces the involved C atoms closer to the Ir(111) surface, implying chemical bond formation. The signature of these bonds in the Ir 4f spectrum was identified. The growth of Pt clusters, their structure, and their interaction with the graphene layer was studied as a function of Pt coverage. {STM} measurements revealed that once Pt clusters are two-layered, their further growth is restricted to two dimensions. The threshold for sintering was found to be at 0.75ML Pt, so that the upper size limit for Pt clusters arranged in a lattice is 65 atoms. The cluster-graphene interaction, as well as the graphene-Ir surface interaction was investigated with spectra of the C 1s and the Ir 4f regions, respectively. It was found that the related components, namely the C 1s shoulder and the Ir interface component, agree regarding their relative intensities. Combining these results, schematic representations of the clusters and their binding geometry with the graphene layer was derived. Pt cluster arrays were tested for their stability with respect to {CO} gas exposure. Cluster stability and adsorption-induced processes were analyzed as a function of cluster size. Small clusters containing fewer than 10 atoms are unstable upon {CO} adsorption. They sinter through Smoluchowski ripening ? cluster diffusion and coalescence ? rather than the frequently reported Ostwald ripening mediated by metal-adsorbate complexes. Larger clusters remain immobile upon {CO} adsorption, but become more three-dimensional. An implication of the {CO}-induced cluster mobility is the sensitivity of Pt cluster array growth to the {CO} background pressure. In order to generalize the results, the study was extended to the adsorption of other gases (H2, O2) on Pt clusters, as well as to the adsorption of {CO} on other metal clusters (Ir, Au). The temperature, time and flake-size-dependent intercalation phases of oxygen underneath graphene on Ir(111) formed upon exposure to molecular oxygen were studied. Through the applied pressure of molecular oxygen, the atomic oxygen created on the bare Ir terraces is driven underneath the graphene flakes. The importance of substrate steps and of the unbinding of graphene flake edges from the substrate for the intercalation is identified. Using {CO} titration to selectively remove oxygen from the bare Ir terraces, the energetics of intercalation were uncovered. Cluster decoration techniques were used as an efficient tool to visualize intercalation processes in real space. To give an outlook, the study was extended to the intercalation of hydrogen. Intercalation of graphene often leads doping of graphene. Comparing {XPS} and angular resolved photoemission spectroscopy ({ARPES}) data for various systems, it was found that the Dirac point and the C 1s core level shift in the same direction. These shifts can be described in terms of a rigid band model and the C 1s core level shift may be used to estimate the level of doping. It was found that graphene?Ir(111)is p-doped by H and O intercalation, whereas it is n-doped after Eu intercalation. The graphene layer is also doped by Pt and Ir clusters on top of it. The smallest clusters n-dope the graphene by charge spill-out. The largest Pt coverage results in a slight p-doping of the graphene layer. When Pt clusters coalesce upon {CO} exposure, the level of doping is reduced.},

	abstract = {Hexagonal boron nitride (h-{BN}) is very attractive for many applications, particularly, as protective coating, dielectric layer/substrate, transparent membrane, or deep ultraviolet emitter. In this work, we carried out a detailed investigation of h-{BN} synthesis on Cu substrate using chemical vapor deposition ({CVD}) with two heating zones under low pressure ({LP}). Previous atmospheric pressure ({AP}) {CVD} syntheses were only able to obtain few layer h-{BN} without a good control on the number of layers. In contrast, under {LPCVD} growth, monolayer h-{BN} was synthesized and time-dependent growth was investigated. It was also observed that the morphology of the Cu surface affects the location and density of the h-{BN} nucleation. Ammonia borane is used as a {BN} precursor, which is easily accessible and more stable under ambient conditions than borazine. The h-{BN} films are characterized by atomic force microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and electron energy loss spectroscopy analyses. Our results suggest that the growth here occurs via surface-mediated growth, which is similar to graphene growth on Cu under low pressure. These atomically thin layers are particularly attractive for use as atomic membranes or dielectric layers/substrates for graphene devices.},

Moreover, another additive, polyethylene glycol as a suppressor, is also employed to reduce oxygen bubbling on polished films.

Even materials that do not form cluster superlattices upon room temperature deposition may be grown into such by low-temperature deposition or the application of cluster seeding through Ir as shown for Au, {AuIr} and {FeIr}. Criteria for the suitability of a material to form a superlattice are given and largely confirmed. It is proven that at least Pt and Ir form epitaxial cluster superlattices. The temperature stability of the cluster superlattices is investigated and understood on the basis of positional fluctuations of the clusters around their sites of minimum potential energy. The binding sites of Ir, Pt, W and Re cluster superlattices are determined and the ability to cover samples macroscopically with a variety of superlattices is demonstrated.},

	abstract = {Using a combination of complementary in situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction, we study the fundamental mechanisms underlying the chemical vapor deposition ({CVD}) of hexagonal boron nitride (h-{BN}) on polycrystalline Cu. The nucleation and growth of h-{BN} layers is found to occur isothermally, i.e., at constant elevated temperature, on the Cu surface during exposure to borazine. A Cu lattice expansion during borazine exposure and B precipitation from Cu upon cooling highlight that B is incorporated into the Cu bulk, i.e., that growth is not just surface-mediated. On this basis we suggest that B is taken up in the Cu catalyst while N is not (by relative amounts), indicating element-specific feeding mechanisms including the bulk of the catalyst. We further show that oxygen intercalation readily occurs under as-grown h-{BN} during ambient air exposure, as is common in further processing, and that this negatively affects the stability of h-{BN} on the catalyst. For extended air exposure Cu oxidation is observed, and upon re-heating in vacuum an oxygen-mediated disintegration of the h-{BN} film via volatile boron oxides occurs. Importantly, this disintegration is catalyst mediated, i.e., occurs at the catalyst/h-{BN} interface and depends on the level of oxygen fed to this interface. In turn, however, deliberate feeding of oxygen during h-{BN} deposition can positively affect control over film morphology. We discuss the implications of these observations in the context of corrosion protection and relate them to challenges in process integration and heterostructure {CVD}.},

Tailored substituents optimize their performance, dictating their arrangement in specific environments and mediating the assembly of molecular nanoarchitectures. Here we review the current understanding of these species at well-defined interfaces, disclosing exquisite insights into their structural and chemical properties, and also discussing methods by which to manipulate their intramolecular and organizational features. The distinct characteristics arising from the interfacial confinement offer intriguing prospects for molecular science and advanced materials. We assess the role of surface interactions with respect to electronic and physicochemical characteristics, and describe in situ metallation pathways, molecular magnetism, rotation and switching.

We interpret these resonances as the effect of a strong and spatially modulated spin–orbit coupling, induced in graphene by the Pb monolayer.

Consideration is also given to the effects of lateral interactions between adsorbates and to the ability of lattice-gas models to provide a representation of the dependences of rate and diffusion coefficients on adsorbate coverage. Finally, the utility of continuum and Monte Carlo models for describing the kinetics of complex surface processes in terms of elementary processes is addressed.},

	abstract = {Many emerging applications of hexagonal boron nitride (h-{BN}) in graphene-based nanoelectronics require high-quality monolayers as the ultrathin dielectric. Here, the nucleation and growth of h-{BN} monolayer on Ru(0001) surface are investigated using scanning tunneling microscopy with a view toward understanding the process of defect formation on a strongly interacted interface. In contrast to homoelemental bonding in graphene, the heteroelemental nature of h-{BN} gives rise to growth fronts with elemental polarity. This can have consequences in the different stages of film growth, from the nucleation of h-{BN} magic clusters and their sintering to form compact triangular islands to the growth of patchwork mosaic monolayer with a high density of misfit boundaries. The parallel alignment of triangular islands on the same terrace produces translational fault lines when growth fronts merge, while antiparallel alignment of islands on adjacent terraces produces non-bonded fault lines between domains terminated by like atoms. With these insights into the generation of void defects and fault lines at grain boundaries, we demonstrate a strategy to obtain high-quality h-{BN} monolayer film based on step flow growth.},

This metalation reaction starts at about 400 K and was investigated at various temperatures up to 500 K. At room temperature, adsorbed 2HTPP adopts an orientation with the molecular plane parallel to the substrate; the same holds for its reaction product {CuTPP} after annealing to 400 K. In contrast, annealing at 450 K yields a tilted orientation of {CuTPP}, as indicated by {STM} and supported by C 1s {XPS} shifts and changes in the Cu(111) surface state. Subsequent annealing at 500 K restores a flat-lying orientation; however, the appearance of the complex in {STM} images differs from the original appearance of {CuTPP}. In summary, 2HTPP undergoes three irreversible transformations upon annealing on Cu(111), a metalation reaction to {CuTPP} followed by two intramolecular structural changes.},

The two layers are offset in such a way as to expose a minimum metal surface area. Hole formation is likely driven by the lattice mismatch of the film and the rhodium substrate.

On the basis of the structures of dislocations, grain boundaries ({GB}) in {BN} are investigated. Depending on the tilt angle of grains, {GB} can be either polar (B-rich or N-rich), constituted by 5{\textbar}7s, or unpolar, composed of 4{\textbar}8s. The polar {GBs} carry net charges, positive at B-rich and negative at N-rich ones. In contrast to {GBs} in graphene which generally impede the electronic transport, polar {GBs} have a smaller bandgap compared to perfect {BN}, which may suggest interesting electronic and optical applications.},

In this paper, we report on the growth of h-{BN} by a low-pressure chemical vapor deposition ({LPCVD}) process using diborane and ammonia as the gas precursors. The use of {LPCVD} allows synthesis of h-{BN} with a controlled number of layers defined by the growth conditions, temperature, time, and gas partial pressure. Furthermore, few-layer h-{BN} was also grown by a sequential growth method, and insights into the growth mechanism are described, thus forming the basis of future growth of h-{BN} by atomic layer epitaxy.},

We consider dopants as boron and nitrogen atoms in graphene and carbon atoms in boron nitride plane. We find that the band width of graphene increases in the presence of impurity atoms. Furthermore, appearing a finite density of states at zero energy due to doping by both boron and nitrogen atoms leads to metallic property in the graphene sheet. Our results also show that doping by carbon reduces the band gap of the boron nitride system. In high concentration of carbon atoms, the density of states of boron nitride plane becomes similar to that of graphene sheet, resulting in semimetallic behavior. We also recognize that the van-Hove singularities in the density of states of both systems are broadened. Moreover, all effects of impurities on their density of states depend on doping concentrations.},

Such changes in the Cu foil could subsequently change the shape and distribution of individual graphene domains grown on the foil surface, and thus influence the domain structure and electrical properties of the resulting graphene films. Here, a slower cooling rate is used after the {CVD} process, and the graphene films are found to have an improved electrical performance, which is considered to be associated with the Cu surface evaporation and grain structure changes in the Cu substrate.},

	abstract = {Volume changes of polyallylamine-derived hydrogels crosslinked with glutaraldehyde are determined with a large variety of effector compounds. Monocarboxylic effectors lead to smaller contractions, in contrast to dicarboxylate structures, which allow more effective non-covalent crosslinking between the positively charged nitrogen centers of the polymer backbone. Electroneutral compounds lead to negligible changes, whereas effectors with either a large p-moiety like in naphthoic acid or phenyl derivatives with polarizable substituents induce large contractions. This finding is in line with significant contributions of van der Waals interactions between the effectors within the hydrogel. Chemomechanical differences between regioisomeric effectors such as p- and o-nitrobenzoic acid are in agreement with independent results of dispersive interactions in related complexes. The volume decrease corresponds almost entirely to the gravimetrically determined water content of the gels. The acidity profile shows a strong contraction above {pH} 10, which is consistent with the known {pK} value of such polyamines. {NMR} spectra of the gels indicate strong binding of the effectors by line broadening, which is significant only for the chemomechanically active compounds.

The programmed geometry and functionality of the molecular module together with its conformational flexibility and substrate interaction yields sinuous metal?organic polymeric assemblies, based on an unusual two-fold Cu?pyridyl coordination motif. An analysis of scanning tunneling microscopy ({STM}) data reveals the occurrence of two enantiomers, resulting from the surface confinement that deconvolutes the module in 2D-chiral conformational isomers. The stereoisomers exhibit site-specific surface anchoring, from whence three discrete orientations are possible for each species. Their sequence and mutual arrangement determine direction and curvature of the metal?organic chains. The Cu-coordinated polymers are very similar on both Cu(111) and Ag(111), where their formation is induced by intrinsic and coevaporated adatoms, respectively, which indicates that the lateral bonding motif is predominantly independent of the substrate. In addition, molecular manipulation experiments show the collective motion of entire segments of the Cu-coordinated multi-porphyrin polymers.},

	abstract = {Carbohelicenes are a class of fascinating chiral helical molecules which have a rich history in chemistry. Over a period of almost 100 years, chemists have developed many methods to prepare them in a racemic or in a non-racemic form. They also possess a series of interesting chiral, physical, electronic and optical properties. However, their utilization in chemistry or chemistry-related fields has rarely appeared in a detailed and comprehensive review. It is the purpose of this review to collect fundamental applications and functions involving carbohelicenes in various disciplines such as in materials science, in nanoscience, in biological chemistry and in supramolecular chemistry. From the numerous synthetic methodologies reported up to now, carbohelicenes and their derivatives can be tailor-made for a better involvement in several subfields. Among those domains are: nanosciences, chemosensing, liquid crystals, molecular switches, polymers, foldamers, supramolecular materials, molecular recognition, conductive and opto-electronic materials, nonlinear optics, chirality studies and asymmetric synthesis. Helicene chemistry is now at a developmental stage, where sufficient application data are now collected and are extremely useful. They provide many more ideas for setting up the basis for future innovative applications.},

The contrast is explained by tunneling through the p-wave orbitals of the {CO} molecule. Comparison with calculations using a Tersoff-Hamann approach, including s- and p-wave tip states, demonstrates the significant contribution of p-wave tip states.},
