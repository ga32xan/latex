\chapter{Experimental methods}
Several experimental methods are used within this work to determine different physical properties. In this chapter we review the principles, benefits and limitations for each method. All of them are well known in surface science and used to analyze thin films on different substrates with respect to their geometric, electronic and chemical properties.

\chapter{Substrates, ad layers and sample preparation}
To conduct experiments in the most controlled environment possible, sample preparation and investigation is done in ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) chambers. With a base pressure of $\approx \SI{5e-10}{\milli \bar}$ these stainless steel chambers are almost free of contaminants. Since the rate at which residual gas contaminates the sample is proportional to the residual partial pressure, the time needed to cover the surface is proportional to it. When the base pressure is lowered by a factor of \SI{1e-13} (\SI{1}{\bar} $\rightarrow$ \SI{1e-10}{\milli \bar}), the time needed to cover the sample is increased by a factor \SI{e13}. 

Experiments were done at different experimental chambers: (1) A LT-STM chamber. \footnote{The technical aspects of the experimental chamber are discussed elsewhere \cite{urgel_tendero_two-dimensional_2015, schwarz_assembly_2018, wiengarten_scanning_2015} and shortly summarized here.} (2) A RT-STM with XPS capabilities. The technical aspects and build details are given in \cite{schwarz_assembly_2018}. (3) The NIM-XPS chamber. 
%This chamber is chosen because of it is possible to investigate chemical properties and coverage with XPS while an UV-Vis spectrometer is used to access the electronic structure of the occupied states. 
(4) A LT-AFM machine offers a complementary investigation method for geometric information. (5) an ex-situ AFM and (6) a SEM.


  \section{Substrates and ad-layers}
Experiments are mainly done with single crystalline substrates of copper and silver, terminated at (111) and (100) surfaces. Polycrystalline copper foils and gold evaporated on mica are used as well. Experiments are done to investigate molecules on \textit{h}-BN/Cu(111) and \textit{h}-BN/Cu(foil), as well.

The following sections will describe the relevant physical properties of the various substrates and will introduce a method to prepare polycrystalline copper foils to grow \textit{h}-BN on. The geometric properties of the resulting lattice mismatched system are discussed briefly. The molecules used for experiments are introduced at the end of the chapter.

\chapter{Borazine functionalized coronene}
Coronene ($C_{24}H_{12}$, known as [6]circulene or superbenzene) is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon made of six carbon rings to form a molecule reminiscent of a small graphene flake. It belongs to the family of circulenes where a central polygon is enclosed by different numbers of fused benzenoids. For example [5]circulene (corannulene), [6]circulene (coronene), [7]circulene,[2][3][4][5] and higher orders could be synthesized and show different conformation. While species with [5] or [7] benzene rings are bowl shaped, coronene is flat.

    %% Orbital calculations
\section{Pyrene}
In this section extended hückel theory calculations of functionalized pyrene molecules are shown. After structural relaxation via the AM1 semi-empirical method in the Hyperchem software, the result is exported to an IGOR script for presentation. Single molecular orbitals as well as their sum can be shown. For all molecules some basic information is given in a box. The number of atoms, electrons and calculated orbitals is given together with a ball and stick model of the corresponding molecule. Calculated HOMO/LUMO states are shown to the right with their energies noted below.
The left side of the pages shows occupied states (second column) and their sum (first column). The right side shows the unoccupied in the same manner.

The first two pages will show cis-pyrene as calculated in gas phase together with a model showing the rotation of pyridil legs and the influence on molecular orbitals. Trans- \& tetra-pyrene molecules are shown afterwards.

Due to the same molecular center, all the species show distinct symmetry at their pyrene center.
