	abstract = {Hexagonal boron nitride (h-{BN}) is very attractive for many applications, particularly, as protective coating, dielectric layer/substrate, transparent membrane, or deep ultraviolet emitter. In this work, we carried out a detailed investigation of h-{BN} synthesis on Cu substrate using chemical vapor deposition ({CVD}) with two heating zones under low pressure ({LP}). Previous atmospheric pressure ({AP}) {CVD} syntheses were only able to obtain few layer h-{BN} without a good control on the number of layers. In contrast, under {LPCVD} growth, monolayer h-{BN} was synthesized and time-dependent growth was investigated. It was also observed that the morphology of the Cu surface affects the location and density of the h-{BN} nucleation. Ammonia borane is used as a {BN} precursor, which is easily accessible and more stable under ambient conditions than borazine. The h-{BN} films are characterized by atomic force microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and electron energy loss spectroscopy analyses. Our results suggest that the growth here occurs via surface-mediated growth, which is similar to graphene growth on Cu under low pressure. These atomically thin layers are particularly attractive for use as atomic membranes or dielectric layers/substrates for graphene devices.},

The significant additive concentration gradient in features, resulting in a selective Cu dissolution rate within features, is explored as a major mechanism that yields such electrolytes with high planarization efficiency. Moreover, another additive, polyethylene glycol as a suppressor, is also employed to reduce oxygen bubbling on polished films. Consequently, a smooth surface with a complete step height elimination is obtained in a 70 Âµm trench after electropolishing. Â© 2003 The Electrochemical Society. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The primary interactions of low-energy x-rays within condensed matter, viz. photoabsorption and coherent scattering, have been described for photon energies outside the absorption threshold regions by using atomic scattering factors. The atomic scattering factors may be accurately determined from the atomic photoabsorption cross sections using modified Kramers-Kronig dispersion relations. From a synthesis of the currently available experimental data and recent theoretical calculations for photoabsorption, the angle-independent, forward-scattering components of the atomic scattering factors have been thus semiempirically determined and tabulated here for 92 elements and for the region 50-30,000 {eV}. Atomic scattering factors for all angles of coherent scattering and at the higher photon energies are obtained from these tabulated forward-scattering values by adding a simple angle-dependent form-factor correction. The incoherent scattering contributions that become significant for the light elements at the higher photon energies are similarly determined. The basic x-ray interaction relations that are used in applied x-ray physics are presented here in terms of the atomic scattering factors. The bulk optical constants are also related to the atomic scattering factors. These atomic and optical relations are applied to the detailed calculation of the reflectivity characteristics of a series of practical x-ray mirror, multilayer, and crystal monochromators. Comparisons of the results of this semiempirical, "atomic-like" description of x-ray interactions for the low-energy region with those of experiment and ab initio theory are presented.},

	abstract = {The effect of atomic oxygen adsorption on the structure and electronic properties of monolayer hexagonal boron nitride (h-{BN}) grown on Ir(111) has been studied using near edge X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy ({NEXAFS}), photoelectron spectroscopy ({PES}), and low-energy electron diffraction ({LEED}). It has been shown that the oxidation of the h-{BN} monolayer occurs through a gradual substitution of N by O in the h-{BN} lattice. This process leads to the formation of defect sites corresponding to three different types of the B atom environment ({BN}3\&\#xa0;-\&\#xa0;{xOx} with x\&\#xa0;=\&\#xa0;1,2,3). The oxidation of the h-{BN} monolayer is very different from the case of graphene on Ir(111), where adsorption of atomic oxygen results mainly in the formation of epoxy groups [J. Phys. Chem. C. 115, 9568 (2011)]. A post-annealing of the h-{BN} monolayer after oxygen exposure results in further destruction of the Bâ€“N bonds and formation of a B2O3-like structure.},

	abstract = {The transmission coefficient D(V) and the tunnel current I(V) for a trapezoidal potential barrier is calculated as a function of applied voltage V. In earlier works the {WKB} approximation was used evaluating the transmission coefficient and therefore only the barrier between the classical turning points was considered. The {WKB} transmission coefficient of a trapezoidal potential barrier is a monotonically decreasing function of applied voltage. In the present paper the exact treatment of the whole barrier shows that the transmission coefficient D(V) can be a function with superposed periodic oscillations. These oscillations are caused by partial reflection and interference of electron waves in the part of the trapezoidal barrier, where the potential energy is less than the kinetic energy of the electron. Also the calculated tunnel current I(V) can have a noticeable superposed oscillation. For observing this oscillation in metal-insulator-metal films the conditions are large electron mean free path (probable some hundred {AE}) in the dielectric layer and specular reflection from the barrier boundaries.},

Previous studies relate the energy shift between peaks of the lowest-order Gundlach oscillation observed on the thin film and the metal substrate to the difference in their work functions. By observing Gundlach oscillations on Ag/Au(111), Ag/Cu(111), and Co/Cu(111) systems, we demonstrate that the work function difference is not the energy shift of the lowest order but the ones of higher order where a constant energy shift exhibits. Higher order Gundlach oscillations can thus be applied to determine the work function of thin metal films precisely.},

This phenomenon can be described as geometrically analogous to lateral interference effects resulting in periodic moiré patterns which are characterized by two-dimensional moiré lattices. Here we discuss in detail the mathematical formalism determining such moiré patterns based on concepts of two-dimensional Fourier transformation including coincidence lattices. The formalism provides simple relations that allow one to calculate possible moiré lattice vectors in their dependence on rotation angles α and scaling factors p 1, p 2 for periodic ( p1 × p 2) R α overlayers on substrate surfaces described by general Bravais lattices. Specific emphasis will be given to hexagonal lattices where experimental data are available.},

	abstract = {From an interplay between variable temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and density–functional theory calculations, the evolution of oxygen chemisorption-induced surface reconstructions of the Cu(110) surface is determined. The surface reconstructions proceed via a sequential pathway with increasing oxygen surface coverage. The (2 × 1) reconstruction occurs first and then transits to the c(6 × 2) phase with a higher oxygen coverage through a mechanism that consumes the existing (2 × 1) phase with the supply of Cu adatoms from step edges and terraces. The temperature dependence of the (2 × 1) → c(6 × 2) transition demonstrates that the surface phase transition is an activated process for breaking up added Cu–O–Cu rows in the (2 × 1) structure. Comparison between the experimental observations and the theoretical surface phase diagram obtained from first-principles thermodynamic calculations reveals that the (2 × 1) → c(6 × 2) transition takes place at the oxygen chemical potentials that are far above the chemical potential for Cu2O bulk oxide formation, reflecting the existence of kinetic limitations to the surface phase transition and the bulk oxide formation.},

Monocarboxylic effectors lead to smaller contractions, in contrast to dicarboxylate structures, which allow more effective non-covalent crosslinking between the positively charged nitrogen centers of the polymer backbone. Electroneutral compounds lead to negligible changes, whereas effectors with either a large p-moiety like in naphthoic acid or phenyl derivatives with polarizable substituents induce large contractions. This finding is in line with significant contributions of van der Waals interactions between the effectors within the hydrogel. Chemomechanical differences between regioisomeric effectors such as p- and o-nitrobenzoic acid are in agreement with independent results of dispersive interactions in related complexes. The volume decrease corresponds almost entirely to the gravimetrically determined water content of the gels. The acidity profile shows a strong contraction above {pH} 10, which is consistent with the known {pK} value of such polyamines. {NMR} spectra of the gels indicate strong binding of the effectors by line broadening, which is significant only for the chemomechanically active compounds.

	abstract = {We employed a de novo synthesized porphyrin module to construct one-dimensional (1D) Cu-coordinated polymers on Cu(111) and Ag(111) surfaces. The programmed geometry and functionality of the molecular module together with its conformational flexibility and substrate interaction yields sinuous metal?organic polymeric assemblies, based on an unusual two-fold Cu?pyridyl coordination motif. An analysis of scanning tunneling microscopy ({STM}) data reveals the occurrence of two enantiomers, resulting from the surface confinement that deconvolutes the module in 2D-chiral conformational isomers. The stereoisomers exhibit site-specific surface anchoring, from whence three discrete orientations are possible for each species. Their sequence and mutual arrangement determine direction and curvature of the metal?organic chains. The Cu-coordinated polymers are very similar on both Cu(111) and Ag(111), where their formation is induced by intrinsic and coevaporated adatoms, respectively, which indicates that the lateral bonding motif is predominantly independent of the substrate. In addition, molecular manipulation experiments show the collective motion of entire segments of the Cu-coordinated multi-porphyrin polymers.},

	abstract = {Using a combination of complementary in situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction, we study the fundamental mechanisms underlying the chemical vapor deposition ({CVD}) of hexagonal boron nitride (h-{BN}) on polycrystalline Cu. The nucleation and growth of h-{BN} layers is found to occur isothermally, i.e., at constant elevated temperature, on the Cu surface during exposure to borazine. A Cu lattice expansion during borazine exposure and B precipitation from Cu upon cooling highlight that B is incorporated into the Cu bulk, i.e., that growth is not just surface-mediated. On this basis we suggest that B is taken up in the Cu catalyst while N is not (by relative amounts), indicating element-specific feeding mechanisms including the bulk of the catalyst. We further show that oxygen intercalation readily occurs under as-grown h-{BN} during ambient air exposure, as is common in further processing, and that this negatively affects the stability of h-{BN} on the catalyst. For extended air exposure Cu oxidation is observed, and upon re-heating in vacuum an oxygen-mediated disintegration of the h-{BN} film via volatile boron oxides occurs. Importantly, this disintegration is catalyst mediated, i.e., occurs at the catalyst/h-{BN} interface and depends on the level of oxygen fed to this interface. In turn, however, deliberate feeding of oxygen during h-{BN} deposition can positively affect control over film morphology. We discuss the implications of these observations in the context of corrosion protection and relate them to challenges in process integration and heterostructure {CVD}.},

At low temperature (T = 170 K), molecular borazine adsorption occurs with the plane of the benzene-like ring parallel to the substrate. Dehydrogenation is observed at temperatures higher than 250 K and extends up to 900 K, with a maximum H2 desorption rate around 300 K. Besides dehydrogenation, room temperature adsorption of borazine leads to the formation of atomic and molecular fragments due to the break-up of part of the {BN} bonds. The epitaxial growth of h-{BN} starts at temperature higher than 1000 K where an extended and long-range ordered layer is obtained. The presence of a corrugation in the h-{BN} layer with moiré periodicity of (13 x 13)/(12 x 12) {BN}/Ir unit cell is reflected in the double component structure of the B 1s and N 1s core level spectra.},
