For this reason, we focused on the use of cheap substrates to achieve the very same functionality as on expensive single crystals. In this chapter copper foils are first chemically polished and prepared for investigation in AFM (p. \pageref{sec:foil-AFM}), SEM (p. \pageref{sec:foil-SEM}) and STM (p. \pageref{sec:foil-STM}). After CVD growth of \textit{h}-BN with borazine, foils are investigated in XPS (compare \autoref{fig:xps-self-grown}) - (discussion of peaks can be found inside the text. Comparable experiments  are performed by \cite[8]{stables_report_2008}). A comparison to bought \textit{h}-BN foils is found at the end of the chapter.
