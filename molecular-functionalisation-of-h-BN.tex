% 
% sudo apt-get install kile texlive-latex-extra texlive-science texlive-bibtex-extra biber
% adjust kile tools to call biber %lS instead of bibtex
%
% If errors occure referring to aux files or others:
%	Delete helper files (*.aux) and maybe others!
%
% Use MikTeX version 2.9.6615 or later (check that biber is included)
% Using BiBLaTex, biber as frontend.
% If biber complains (ERROR - Error: Found biblatex control file version 2.6, expected version 3.4.)
% 	Update with your Miktex package manager (mpm_mfc.exe[single user install] or mpm_mfc_admin.exe [all user install])
% no new biblatex version there? Sync database? NO omprovement!
