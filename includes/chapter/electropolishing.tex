As was mentioned before, clean, highly ordered surfaces are desirable to perform experiments on. Effort is done to clean the surfaces before every experiment to ensure a reproducible environment and interpretable results. This lead to a detailed understanding of the physics and chemistry behind a lot of systems. In case a systems order and functionality does not heavily depend on the substrates symmetry, single crystals loose most of their unique selling point. Instead of choosing a expensive bulk single crystal, thin copper foils can catch up in production environments. The mass produced foils still show some inconvenient properties. Although pure copper foils ($\geq \SI{99.999}{\percent}$) are available, their surface was never meant to be atomically flat. 
A representation of a copper surface before electro polishing can be seen in figure \ref{fig:copper-foil-grains}. Here the layered structure of the (mechanically polished) foil is apparent and shows different sizes of grains and annealing twins at the surface. Small subgrains constitute the uppermost layers, while deeper lying layers consist of larger grains with grain boundaries becoming more and more diffuse with increasing distance to the surface.

But growing high quality ad-layers on polycrystalline copper foils requires a smooth surface. As-ordered Cu foils exhibit a root-mean-square (RMS) surface roughness of about \SI{218}{\nm}\cite{bin_zhang_low-temperature_2012}. Striations - a fabrication remnant due to the cold rolled foils - are observed on the surface\cite{kim_synthesis_2012-1}. Also some manufacturers apply a thin layer of chromium oxide for corrosion protection\cite{bin_zhang_low-temperature_2012}. A common procedure to reduce the roughness of a material is to electrochemical polish the surface.

A comprehensive overview of \index{electrochemical polishing} electrochemical polishing of Cu surfaces with different etchants can be found in \cite{jinshan_electrochemical_2004}. The following gives a short introduction in chemical polishing as used for preparation of thin copper foils.\footnote{For a broader view on the topic, the reader is pointed to references \cite{antoine_polishing_1999, lilje_improved_2004, schulz_engeneering_2018}.}

\paragraph{solution of anode atoms in aqueous cell medium}
Electrons and atoms at the solid surface have higher energy states. Thus some of the atoms on the metal surface may lose electrons to form ions. These ions may also recombine with electrons and become atoms at another moment. Depending on the electronic structures, some metals (such as sodium) are easier than others (such as platinum) to ionize. Copper is relatively stable. Still, some of the surface atoms may be expected to ionize at a moment. The ionization process may be promoted when the metal is in touch with aqueous solution because: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item Metal ions can not move in the metal electrode but can move through the solution, producing electric current in solution with an applied potential
	\item Electrons can move freely in metal solid (electric current in a metal) but can not survive in solution and will quickly recombine with positive ions
	\item Water dipoles and negative ions in solution may drag the surface metal ions into the solution
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{chemical reaction}\index{electrochemical polishing!chemical reaction}
``The electrode connected to the positive pole of the power supply is called anode. And the one connected to the negative pole of the power supply is called cathode. When the applied voltage is high enough, electrons in the anode may be pumped out and the metal atoms on the anode surface will be oxidized (e.g., $Cu - 2e = Cut^{2+}$) and dissolved into the electrolyte solution. Under electrical field, the positive ions (cations) move towards cathode and negative ions (anions) move towards anode. The cations may get electrons and be reduced to neutral atoms (e.g., $Cu^{2-} + 2e = Cu$) again at the cathode surface. Therefore, charge transfer between the two electrodes is carried out via the ion drift in the electrolyte and electron conduction in metal wire. When the working electrode is set to be anode, dissolution is processed at certain potential. Likewise, when the working electrode is set to be cathode, it can result in deposition. For electropolishing of copper, the copper part to be polished is set to be anode while the cathode can be any conductive material (e.g., copper).

The critical potential at which the oxidation / reduction starts to occur is related to the standard redox potential for a specific anode material. The redox potential $E_O$ is a measure (in volts) of the affinity of a substance for electrons - its electronegativity - compared with hydrogen (which is set at 0). Substances more strongly electronegative (i.e., capable of oxidizing or accepting electrons) than hydrogen have positive redox potentials (e.g., $Cu/CU^{2+}$: $E_O = \SI{0.34}{\volt}$). Substances less electronegative (i.e., capable of reducing or giving up electrons) than hydrogen have negative redox potentials (e.g., $Cr^{3+}/Cr^{2+}$: $E_O = \SI{-1.07}{\volt}$)\cite{jinshan_electrochemical_2004}

\paragraph{Removed mass from working electrode}
``The current flow of every two electrons results in one copper atom dissolved on the anode and deposited on the cathode. Since $\SI{1}{\ampere}= \SI{1}{\coulomb \second}$, the charge of one electron $e = \SI{1.60218E16}{\coulomb}$, so the number of electrons (per second) in 1 A current is $N_e = \frac{I}{e}$; the number of copper atoms being oxidized or reduced $N_a= \frac{1}{2} N_e= \frac{I}{2e}$, the number of moles $N_m = \frac{N_a}{N_A} = \frac{I}{2eN_A}= \frac{I}{2F}$ where Avogadro's number $N_A = \SI{6.02214E23}{\per \mole}$. The weight of $N_m$ mole copper $W = N_m M = \frac{IM}{2 F}$ where M is the molecular weight of copper. Thats a volume, $V = W / d =\frac{IM}{2 F d}$ where d is the density of copper. Thus a current I produces a dissolution/deposition rate in thickness (\SI{}{\centi\meter \per \second}) \begin{equation} R_d=\frac{M}{2 FdA}I \label{dissolution-rate}\end{equation}
where A is the area of the electrode surface.
\cite[34]{jinshan_electrochemical_2004}

\paragraph{Voltage-current-characteristic or polarization curve}
\begin{itemize}
	\item[-]On a polycrystalline metal surface there are sites, such as defects and grain boundaries, where atoms are at higher energy states. In addition, due to arbitrary crystal orientation, there are different crystalline planes with different energy states of atoms on the electrode surface. Therefore, atoms at all these different sites and planes have different standard redox potential $E_O$, and as a result, have different dissolution rate according to eq. \ref{dissolution-rate}. Such an anodic dissolution will not lead to polishing. Instead, a crystallographic etching is produced (reference [9, 33-35] within \cite{jinshan_electrochemical_2004}). This is true at lower current (or applied potential). This refers to the \textbf{"etching"} regime in figure \ref{fig:oxygen-pitting} with $U<\SI{1.5}{\volt}$.
	\item[-]The plateau where the current remains almost constant with increasing voltage is referred to as \textbf{"polishing plateau"}. Overall, the values of iL and EL of the limiting current plateau and the shape of a polarization curve depends on electrolyte solution, anode material, disk rotating speed, solution circulation, temperature, and the distance between anode and cathode.
	Of all the factors, electrolyte is the most important one determining the polarization curve.
	\item[-]With continuing increase of applied potential, other reactions than Cu oxidation and reduction may occur and contribute to the increasing current. These reactions produce $H_2$ and $O_2$ bubbles, which occur at or reach the anode surface. This is known as \textbf{"oxygen pitting"}.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{gas bubbling}
Gas (oxygen or hydrogen) bubbles may block $Cu^{2+}$ ion transport and therefore terminate the electrochemical dissolution process on the area inside the bubbles. However, the residual solution on the surface area inside the bubbles may react with Cu atom and result in chemical etching. Depending on the chemical property of the electrolyte solution and the value of current density at which the electrochemical dissolution is occurring, the etching speed can be higher than the rate of electrochemical dissolution. In this case, pits will be produced on the anode and produce a rough surface. If etching does not occur inside the bubbles, or if its speed is slower than that of electrochemical dissolution process, the area inside the bubbles will remain and appears as protruding particles after the electrochemical dissolution process. In either case, a rough surface is produced. Approaches to reduce the effect of oxygen bubbling are done by altering the etching solution with different additives.

\paragraph{Etching solutions in literature} 
To find the most adequate polishing recipe, the most common ones have been reviewed and will be shown in the following. Many etching processes of Cu foils base of phosphoric acid that is refered to as ortho-phosphoric-acid, too. Liquid phosphoric acid is an 85\% aqueous solution. \cite{_7664-38-2_2014} 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Here (table \ref{tab:etching-recipes}), some of the etching recipes are given as reported in literature. They all have been used to electrochemically polish the Cu foil prior to graphene or boron nitride growth. We will discuss the used recipes in the following with focus on the additives used.

Different additives to the acid are used to gain a better control of the etching process.  A typical one is PEG.\footnote{Further additives are used in etching solutions. Isopropanol and Ethanol are introduced for a more stable current density. HEDP increases the critical current density in phosphoric acid solutions\cite{jinshan_electrochemical_2004} and therefore the reaction rate. Citric acid is also used at low concentrations \SI{1000}{pppm} \cite{chang_superpolishing_2003}}  

One may add PEG for reduced oxygen bubbling during the process (compare fig. \ref{fig:oxygen-pitting})\cite{stables_report_2008,chang_superpolishing_2003}. It was shown that a concentration of \SI{1000}{ppm} PEG decreases the amount of oxygen pits. A comparison between electro polished foils with and without PEG are shown in figure \ref{PEG-additive}. After etching with purely phosphoric acid the surface remains rough and covered with pits. After adding PEG to the polishing solution the resulting foil shows a smoothened surface with little oxygen pits left.

A detailed investigation on polishing solutions based on phosphoric acid can be found in \cite{jinshan_electrochemical_2004}. It was found that adding EG into phosphoric acid solutions decreases the  limiting current. The more EG added the lower the limiting current. This is true for both undiluted and diluted (with deionized water) phosphoric acid solution. Diluting phosphoric acid - EG solutions with water (25\%, curve 2 in Fig. 3-10 within \cite{jinshan_electrochemical_2004} ) increases limiting current as shown in table \ref{table:used-etching-solutions}. Further diluting phosphoric acid - EG solutions with water (5O\%, curve 3 in Fig. 3-10 (within \cite{jinshan_electrochemical_2004} )) decreases limiting current. Limiting current plateau disappears at \SI{12.5}{\percent} phosphoric acid + \SI{37.5}{\percent}EG + \SI{50}{\percent} water. 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
As the etching times are quiet long, efforts have been made to reduce the polishing time by varying the polishing solution. Results with a more complicated etching recipe \cite{bin_zhang_low-temperature_2012} are depicted in figure \ref{fig:etching-bin-zhang}. Here the etching was performed with a large copper plate used as cathode. Alligator clamps are used to apply a voltage of \SIrange{3}{6}{\volt} between the foil and the plate. The foil is used as anode (+). After \SI{1}{\minute} the foil is taken out and rinsed with deionized water, further washed with ethanol, and then dried with compressed nitrogen gas. 

The height profile of the copper foil surface before and after treatment indicate diminishing striation height and overall roughness from $\approx \SIrange{218}{64}{\nano \meter}$ within a very short period of time. Although the surface is still rather irregular, a dominant orientation of the remaining grains is observed in the (001) direction and helps the subsequent growth of graphene with toluene to form rectangular flakes.

Within this work, Cu-foil polishing will be done with recipe I broken down in table \ref{tab:used-etching-solution}. It has several advantages. Since the main goal is the achieve a virtually flat surface, the resulting roughness of the surface is the most important parameter. In contrast to etching recipes without PEG (where oxygen pitting is an issue) and more complex etching recipes (to reduce etching time on exchange on surface roughness) a simple etching solution is chosen.

%The given roughness in table \ref{table:used-etching-solutions}is much lower compared to references (\SI{61}{\nm})\cite[2]{bin_zhang_low-temperature_2012} that did the polishing with another recipe (compare table \ref{tab:etching-recipes}). Although the roughness is higher, optical profiler images indicate removed striations and a smoother surface compared to the as-bought foils (\SI{218,56}{\nm})\cite[2]{bin_zhang_low-temperature_2012}.

\paragraph{The etching process}
The etching process relies on the fact that the current density (and thus the etching rate) is higher in protruding regions of the copper foil (Ohmic leveling).  As a result the surface of the copper foil will be smoothened \cite{luo_effect_2011}. Compare with migration smoothing and diffusion smoothing\cite{jinshan_electrochemical_2004}.
