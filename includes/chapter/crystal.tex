 ``This surface consists of (111) terraces (three close-packed rows wide) and intrinsic (100) steps, which run parallel to the [011] direction. The close-packed atom rows located at the step edges are characterized by
a nearest-neighbor distance of \SI{2.55}{\angstrom}  for Cu and of \SI{2.89}{\angstrom} for Ag, whereas the intrinsic step
spacing is \SI{6.25}{\angstrom} for Cu and \SI{7.08}{\angstrom} for Ag. The surface symmetry is described by a primitive
rectangular unit cell (cf. Figure 3.1a). The (111) terraces and the micro facets which represent the intrinsic (100) steps are tilted by \SI{19.5}{\degree}, respectively, to macroscopic (211) surface, which can be seen in the side view of the hard-sphere model in the upper panel of Figure 3.1a. The interlayer spacing for this surface is \SI{0.74}{\angstrom} for Cu and \SI{0.83}{\angstrom} for Ag.''

Dense packed rows are for fcc(111) the following directions: $<\bar 1 01>$, $<01\bar 1>$, $<1\bar 1 0>$. The diagonals are found in the $<\bar 1 \bar 1 2>$ and $<1\bar 2 1>$ directions.

``The (311) surface consists also of (111) terraces (two close-packed rows wide) and intrinsic (100) steps.''

Cu(100) has a step height of \SI{1.8}{\angstrom}. \textbf{See http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.94.064106}
See \cite{riemann_ionic_2002} for another examples of vicinal metal surfaces (531),(532),(221),(311),(211).

The surface free energy increases from the (111) surface with increasing angle of the (hkl) surface of interest $$\cos(\phi)=\frac{h+k+l}{\sqrt{3(h^2+k^2+l^2)}}$$ \cite{jian-min_calculation_2004}. Thus, the (111) surface is the one with lowest energy, followed by (110) and (100).

\subsection{Dislocation lines and crystal orientation}
Due to the fact, that dislocation lines move within the crystal in a defined manner, one can determine the crystals orientation when the orientation of a dislocation is known.
As for FCC crystals the orientation of dislocation lines occurs in the {111} plane in $<110>$ direction. Its Burgers vector is $\frac{a}{2}[110]$\cite{_dislocation-theory}.
