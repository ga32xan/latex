%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%TBP on h-BN/Cu(111)
Further experiments have can done to investigate the behaviour of TBP on h-BN. When adsorbed on h-BN/Cu(111), molecules show a high mobility that makes the molecules move away from the h-BN islands. Some molecules could be resolved at defects or close to the perimeter of the h-BN islands.
