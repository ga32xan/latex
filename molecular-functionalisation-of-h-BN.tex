\chapter{Experimental methods}
Several experimental methods are used within this work to determine different physical properties. All of them are well known in surface science and used to analyze thin films on different substrates with respect to their geometric, electronic and chemical properties.
In this chapter the principles, benefits and limitations for scanning tunneling microscopy (\autoref{section:stm}), X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy (\autoref{section:xps}) and atomic force microscopy (\autoref{section:afm}) are reviewed.

\chapter{Substrates, ad layers and sample preparation}
 Experiments are mainly done with single crystalline substrates of copper and silver, terminated by (111) and (100) surfaces. Polycrystalline copper foils and gold evaporated on mica are used as well. Experiments are done to investigate molecules on \textit{h}-BN/Cu(111) and \textit{h}-BN/Cu(foil).
 
  \section{Substrates and adlayers}
The following section will describe the relevant physical properties of the various substrates. First single crystal (\autoref{sec:single-crystal}) and polycrystalline copper foil substrates (\autoref{sec:copper-foils}) are discussed briefly. Geometric properties of lattice mismatched system are discussed briefly (see \autoref{section:moire}). Later molecular adlayers on \textit{h}-BN are exemplified by 2H-Porphine and $\textnormal{NC}\textnormal{Ph}_4\textnormal{CN}$ on \textit{h}-BN (\autoref{section:Mol-on-h-BN}). A method to prepare polycrystalline copper foils to grow \textit{h}-BN on is discussed in \autoref{sec:etching}. Preparation details for cleaning metal substrate samples (\autoref{sec:sample-cleaning}), CVD growth recipe for \textit{h}-BN dosage (\autoref{sec:h-BN-growth}) and molecular beam epitaxy (\autoref{sec:molecule-deposition}) will be summarized at the end of this chapter.

\section{\textbf{E}xtended \textbf{H}ückel \textbf{t}herory calculations}
In the following extended Hückel theory calculations of functionalized pyrene molecules are shown. After structural relaxation via the AM1 semi-empirical method in the Hyperchem software, the result is exported to an IGOR script for presentation. Single molecular orbitals as well as their sum can be shown. For all molecules some basic information is given in a box. The number of atoms, electrons and calculated orbitals is given together with a ball and stick model of the corresponding molecule. Calculated HOMO/LUMO states are shown to the right with their energies noted below.
The left side of the pages shows occupied states (second column) and their sum (first column). The right side shows the unoccupied in the same manner.

The first two pages will show cis-pyrene as calculated in gas phase together with a model showing the rotation of pyridil legs and the influence on molecular orbitals. Trans- \& tetra-pyrene molecules are shown afterwards.

Due to the same molecular center, all the species show distinct symmetry towards their pyrene center.
