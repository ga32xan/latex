Further experiments were carried out to increase the cleanliness of the \textit{h}-BN on the polycrystalline copper foil. To reduce the amount of elements coming from the body of the foil, it is repeatedly sputtered and annealed to temperatures as high as \SI{800}{\celsius}. This may have also an improving influence on the grain size and amount of corrugation. Several attempts have been made which are described in summary below.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{itemize}
 \item After cleaning, the sample is investigated in STM. The foil shows a inhomogeneous topography, with parts of the sample showing very flat regions while others still remain heavily corrugated and not scan able in STM. 
 A first look onto the quite heterogeneous surface reveals flat areas with a typical roughness of $\approx \SI{70}{\pico\meter}$ exist (\autoref{fig:cu-foil-clean}). Areas with very large corrugations $\geq \SI{100}{nm}$ are hard to scan in STM and bad places for \textit{h}-BN growth. Although being flat, the polycrystalline foil shows a lot of unordered substrate steps and a dirty surface, covered with adsorbates imaged as small bright dots.
\end{itemize}

Borazine was dosed with the same pressure as before (\SI{1e-7}{\milli \bar}) but for 1min and at a lower temperature of \SI{750}{\celsius}. After the preparation the sample was kept at \SI{750}{\celsius} for another 1 minute. It was cooled down slowly (shown in figure \ref{fig:h-bn-overgrown-cu-1}).

% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% false preparation %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% The next preparation step was started with an intense cleaning step of the copper foil. It was sputtered and annealed to \SI{750}{\celsius} twice and then kept at \SI{830}{\celsius} for 2 hours. After this it was sputtered and annealed to \SI{750}{\celsius} for 1 minute before the borazine was dosed. Unfortunatly the exact amount of borazine could not be determined, the pressure increased to \SI{1e-4}{\milli \bar} for a very short time, so that the dosage was interrupted well below 1 minute. It was again hold at the temperature for another minute and was cooled down very slow (\SIrange{1}{3}{\kelvin \per \second}). The mass spectrum taken after deposition shows the highest peak not where the intact borazine molecule is located but somewhere to lower masses. This indicates that the borazine has decomposed.

\begin{itemize}
 \item The foil was sputtered and annealed 4 times with temperatures of \SI{800}{\celsius}. Borazine was dosed at \SI{2e-7}{\milli \bar} for \SI{2.5}{\minute}. The sample was kept at this temperature for another 5 minutes after dosing. The sample was cooled down slowly. \autoref{fig:h-bn-overgrown-cu-1} shows some of the grown islands. The copper surface changes upon \textit{h}-BN growth and the terrace width increases below the \textit{h}-BN flakes. The typical faceting of the surface vanishes or can at least not be depicted because of the overgrowing \textit{h}-BN (\autoref{fig:h-bn-overgrown-cu-2}). Due to nearby tip forming, the right side of the image is decorated with adsorbate, most likely from the tip itself - they appear as bright white spots in the image.

\paragraph{surface structure of \textit{h}-BN on Cu-foil}



During experiments some ``new'' structure appeared (compare figure \ref{fig:tpcn-on-cu-foil}).
The apparent height change between the both terraces is \SI{130}{\pico \meter} seperated by a slim 
trench that is slightly lower than the right terrace (\SI{50}{\pico \meter}). The parallel stripes have an apparent corrugation of \SI{25}{\pico \meter} and are seperated \SI{70}{\pico \meter} from each other and covering the whole image. 

The adsorbed TPCN molecules show different apparent heights in their molecular center.
