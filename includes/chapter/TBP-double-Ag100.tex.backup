% TBP-double-Ag100
When adsoped on a (100) silver surface, the molecules arrange in a nice pattern (see figure \ref{fig:two-leg-trans-agg100-motiv}). Although the pattern is dense no problems showed up when designing the molcular models. This is because the last molcules at the perimeter of this island is nicely distinguishable and continuing their regular pattern to the center of the island results in a accurate description of the island.
