Molecules adsorb on the BN surface and STM imaging is hard due to molecules that can be moved on the rather 'slippy' surface of the insulating BN. Nevertheless some agglomerations of the molecules leave free BN spots where no molecules are. As the preparation of the BN should result in a closed BN layer on top of the Cu-foil no movement of molecules to free Cu areas should be observed, making these free regions BN regions.

Why the molecules are not distributed homogenously on the BN remains topic to speculation.

Spectroscopy has been tried intensly but without reproduceable results.

Unlike the adsorption on Ag(100) and Cu(111) no formation of di- and quatermers has been observed.
