\paragraph{How to determine molecules' distance}
To determine the distance between molecules, one has to carefuly choose the points of interest. As a problem of STM imaging the contour of the molecules sometimes appears as more or less fuzzy shape. There is no sharp edge that one could take as start or end point of the profile. Therefore the center of the molecule is often used as reference point to measure the distance between two molecules (compare fig. \ref{fig:distance-molecules}). As the molecule has a square footprint, one can use the center in one direction (along profile 2/3) to determine the center in the other direction (profile 1). As one can see the three profiles match leading to a consistent center of the dimer. This is also shown as depression in profile 1.

\caption{Sketch of how to determine the distance between two molecules. As the molecule is square (with the exception of one direction, one can determine the center of the molecule by comparing two 90 degree rotated profiles. Profile 1 goes through the symmetry axis, while profile 2 and 3 intersect profile 1 at the center. As the profile 2 and 3 look the same when starting at the buthyl groups, one can use the depression in profile 2 and 3 to determine the center of the molecule in profile 1.}

Evaporation of one and two-leg nitro porphyrines on Ag(100)

The appearence of STM data is correlated to the molecular configuration according to \cite{mishra_current-driven_2015} meaning that the lobes consiting of (3,5-di-tert-butylphenyl) are images as bright protrusions, while the functional nitro group is imaged fainter.

To achive an optical identification of different molecular configurations, some possible arrangements have been modeled for Mono-, Di- and Quatermers.

\caption{Some possible arrangement of di- and tetramers. The white bars and dots indicate the pattern one would observe highlighted in STM when the phenyl rings dominate the signal}

\end{figure}
Comparing the models with the STM images shows a good agreement between model and image when the butylphenyl groups are dominant in the signal.

The models match the shape of the dimer very well and is accurate even the the quatermer case, where two dimers are attached parallel via their butylphenyl groups. The interaction between the butylphenyl groups is considered to be van der Waals like \cite{iacovita_controlling_2012}.

Model and image differ for the cross-shaped quatermers, where the model suggests a dark center and the image shows a non vanishing DOS within the bias voltage around the fermi level.

Some spectroscopy could be achieved that shows different typical features for different areas in the molecule. Note that the spectra were done for molecules sitting on a Ag(100) surface.
There is a clear indication, that the macrocylce of the molecule contributes to the broad peak in the dI/dV data at around \SI{1}{\V}, while the nitro groups dominate the spectra at around \SI{600}{\V}. 
Look at the corresponding .pptx file for the spectra and the corresponding IGOR-files dimer/quatermer1-2 for the spectra.
