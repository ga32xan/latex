After several scans in close proximity legs at positions 2 and 3 flip around and change their orientation to 1: clockwise, 2: clockwise, 3: counterclockwise. This results in a changed adsorption geometry. First the upper right edge is lifted from the substrate, while after the leg rearrangement the lower right edge is lifted from the surface. This is caused by the lower lying dimethyl groups lifting the phenyl ring and the molecule's edge connected to it.}

The highest features are enclosed by white circles. In the middle column, all phenyl rings are parallel to  the image plane, resulting in six features in the calculated image above the dimethyl groups. Columns to the left/right show AFM images as would be expected by a rotation of the dimethylphenyl rings by $\pm \SI{20}{\degree}$. The rotation direction is chosen as described in \autoref{fig:HBBNC-nc-AFM-legs-change} and reproduces the highest appearing spots in the AFM images well. The used code was published as web tool \cite{_AFM_calc} and bases on  \cite{hapala_origin_2014,hapala_mechanism_2014}.}
