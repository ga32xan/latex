% tbp-double on Cu(111)
When depositing trans-TBP on Cu(111) at room temperature no strict ordering can be achieved. The molecules arrange rather arbitrarily as can be seen in figure \ref{fig:two-leg-trans-cu111}.

The molecules tend to connect in a difined angle to its next neighbour, forming different binding motivs. These are predominantly different kind of chain formation (see figure \ref{fig:two-leg-trans-cu111-motivs}).
\begin{itemize}
 \item The molecules are ordered such that they form a straight chain (trans-nitro-on-cu111-70).
 \item The molecules arrange in chains, but each molecule has an offset of about a half of its width to the next neighbour or the molecules attach in chains, but show a kink.
\end{itemize}

During modelling figure \ref{fig:two-leg-trans-cu111-motivs} the molecules are shown in their non interacting geometry. Note that every second molecule (in the model) is rotated by \SI{180}{\degree} to match the image best (one can see an repeating pattern where two adjacent molecules' butyl groups are alternating between two distances - either further away on one side and closer on the other side of the chain or vice versa). One can see, that their butyl-group nicely match the image in size and position when rotated. 

Having a closer look to the nitro groups, one recognizes a close proximity of these to each other. Also note the light protrusions in between two adjacent molecules' butyl groups. If the legs are rotaded by just \SI{15}{\degree}, the nitro groups would point to these protrusions. This rotation costs not much energy and is about \SI{25}{\kilo\J/per\mol} (( please cite something, value is for rotated phenyl ring at a porphine core I guess )). Considering these protrusions as Cu-adatoms (already occured in chapter \ref{chapter:TPCN-adatoms} as protrusions in between TPCN chains which may change their position in discrete position in the molecule.) This Cu-adtom may direct the binding of the nitro groups towards it, making them bend outwards. The position of the cooper atom itself may rely on its registry to the substrate - preferring a threefold coordination site as known for copper (( citation )).
