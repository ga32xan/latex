The significant additive concentration gradient in features, resulting in a selective Cu dissolution rate within features, is explored as a major mechanism that yields such electrolytes with high planarization efficiency. Moreover, another additive, polyethylene glycol as a suppressor, is also employed to reduce oxygen bubbling on polished films. Consequently, a smooth surface with a complete step height elimination is obtained in a 70 Âµm trench after electropolishing. Â© 2003 The Electrochemical Society. All rights reserved.},

	shorttitle = {X-Ray Interactions},
	abstract = {The primary interactions of low-energy x-rays within condensed matter, viz. photoabsorption and coherent scattering, have been described for photon energies outside the absorption threshold regions by using atomic scattering factors. The atomic scattering factors may be accurately determined from the atomic photoabsorption cross sections using modified Kramers-Kronig dispersion relations. From a synthesis of the currently available experimental data and recent theoretical calculations for photoabsorption, the angle-independent, forward-scattering components of the atomic scattering factors have been thus semiempirically determined and tabulated here for 92 elements and for the region 50-30,000 {eV}. Atomic scattering factors for all angles of coherent scattering and at the higher photon energies are obtained from these tabulated forward-scattering values by adding a simple angle-dependent form-factor correction. The incoherent scattering contributions that become significant for the light elements at the higher photon energies are similarly determined. The basic x-ray interaction relations that are used in applied x-ray physics are presented here in terms of the atomic scattering factors. The bulk optical constants are also related to the atomic scattering factors. These atomic and optical relations are applied to the detailed calculation of the reflectivity characteristics of a series of practical x-ray mirror, multilayer, and crystal monochromators. Comparisons of the results of this semiempirical, "atomic-like" description of x-ray interactions for the low-energy region with those of experiment and ab initio theory are presented.},

It has been shown that the oxidation of the h-{BN} monolayer occurs through a gradual substitution of N by O in the h-{BN} lattice. This process leads to the formation of defect sites corresponding to three different types of the B atom environment ({BN}3\&\#xa0;-\&\#xa0;{xOx} with x\&\#xa0;=\&\#xa0;1,2,3). The oxidation of the h-{BN} monolayer is very different from the case of graphene on Ir(111), where adsorption of atomic oxygen results mainly in the formation of epoxy groups [J. Phys. Chem. C. 115, 9568 (2011)]. A post-annealing of the h-{BN} monolayer after oxygen exposure results in further destruction of the Bâ€“N bonds and formation of a B2O3-like structure.},

	abstract = {The transmission coefficient D(V) and the tunnel current I(V) for a trapezoidal potential barrier is calculated as a function of applied voltage V. In earlier works the {WKB} approximation was used evaluating the transmission coefficient and therefore only the barrier between the classical turning points was considered. The {WKB} transmission coefficient of a trapezoidal potential barrier is a monotonically decreasing function of applied voltage. In the present paper the exact treatment of the whole barrier shows that the transmission coefficient D(V) can be a function with superposed periodic oscillations. These oscillations are caused by partial reflection and interference of electron waves in the part of the trapezoidal barrier, where the potential energy is less than the kinetic energy of the electron. Also the calculated tunnel current I(V) can have a noticeable superposed oscillation. For observing this oscillation in metal-insulator-metal films the conditions are large electron mean free path (probable some hundred {AE}) in the dielectric layer and specular reflection from the barrier boundaries.},

Previous studies relate the energy shift between peaks of the lowest-order Gundlach oscillation observed on the thin film and the metal substrate to the difference in their work functions. By observing Gundlach oscillations on Ag/Au(111), Ag/Cu(111), and Co/Cu(111) systems, we demonstrate that the work function difference is not the energy shift of the lowest order but the ones of higher order where a constant energy shift exhibits. Higher order Gundlach oscillations can thus be applied to determine the work function of thin metal films precisely.},

This phenomenon can be described as geometrically analogous to lateral interference effects resulting in periodic moiré patterns which are characterized by two-dimensional moiré lattices. Here we discuss in detail the mathematical formalism determining such moiré patterns based on concepts of two-dimensional Fourier transformation including coincidence lattices. The formalism provides simple relations that allow one to calculate possible moiré lattice vectors in their dependence on rotation angles α and scaling factors p 1, p 2 for periodic ( p1 × p 2) R α overlayers on substrate surfaces described by general Bravais lattices. Specific emphasis will be given to hexagonal lattices where experimental data are available.},

	abstract = {From an interplay between variable temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and density–functional theory calculations, the evolution of oxygen chemisorption-induced surface reconstructions of the Cu(110) surface is determined. The surface reconstructions proceed via a sequential pathway with increasing oxygen surface coverage. The (2 × 1) reconstruction occurs first and then transits to the c(6 × 2) phase with a higher oxygen coverage through a mechanism that consumes the existing (2 × 1) phase with the supply of Cu adatoms from step edges and terraces. The temperature dependence of the (2 × 1) → c(6 × 2) transition demonstrates that the surface phase transition is an activated process for breaking up added Cu–O–Cu rows in the (2 × 1) structure. Comparison between the experimental observations and the theoretical surface phase diagram obtained from first-principles thermodynamic calculations reveals that the (2 × 1) → c(6 × 2) transition takes place at the oxygen chemical potentials that are far above the chemical potential for Cu2O bulk oxide formation, reflecting the existence of kinetic limitations to the surface phase transition and the bulk oxide formation.},

	abstract = {Volume changes of polyallylamine-derived hydrogels crosslinked with glutaraldehyde are determined with a large variety of effector compounds. Monocarboxylic effectors lead to smaller contractions, in contrast to dicarboxylate structures, which allow more effective non-covalent crosslinking between the positively charged nitrogen centers of the polymer backbone. Electroneutral compounds lead to negligible changes, whereas effectors with either a large p-moiety like in naphthoic acid or phenyl derivatives with polarizable substituents induce large contractions. This finding is in line with significant contributions of van der Waals interactions between the effectors within the hydrogel. Chemomechanical differences between regioisomeric effectors such as p- and o-nitrobenzoic acid are in agreement with independent results of dispersive interactions in related complexes. The volume decrease corresponds almost entirely to the gravimetrically determined water content of the gels. The acidity profile shows a strong contraction above {pH} 10, which is consistent with the known {pK} value of such polyamines. {NMR} spectra of the gels indicate strong binding of the effectors by line broadening, which is significant only for the chemomechanically active compounds.

	abstract = {We employed a de novo synthesized porphyrin module to construct one-dimensional (1D) Cu-coordinated polymers on Cu(111) and Ag(111) surfaces. The programmed geometry and functionality of the molecular module together with its conformational flexibility and substrate interaction yields sinuous metal?organic polymeric assemblies, based on an unusual two-fold Cu?pyridyl coordination motif. An analysis of scanning tunneling microscopy ({STM}) data reveals the occurrence of two enantiomers, resulting from the surface confinement that deconvolutes the module in 2D-chiral conformational isomers. The stereoisomers exhibit site-specific surface anchoring, from whence three discrete orientations are possible for each species. Their sequence and mutual arrangement determine direction and curvature of the metal?organic chains. The Cu-coordinated polymers are very similar on both Cu(111) and Ag(111), where their formation is induced by intrinsic and coevaporated adatoms, respectively, which indicates that the lateral bonding motif is predominantly independent of the substrate. In addition, molecular manipulation experiments show the collective motion of entire segments of the Cu-coordinated multi-porphyrin polymers.},

	abstract = {Using a combination of complementary in situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction, we study the fundamental mechanisms underlying the chemical vapor deposition ({CVD}) of hexagonal boron nitride (h-{BN}) on polycrystalline Cu. The nucleation and growth of h-{BN} layers is found to occur isothermally, i.e., at constant elevated temperature, on the Cu surface during exposure to borazine. A Cu lattice expansion during borazine exposure and B precipitation from Cu upon cooling highlight that B is incorporated into the Cu bulk, i.e., that growth is not just surface-mediated. On this basis we suggest that B is taken up in the Cu catalyst while N is not (by relative amounts), indicating element-specific feeding mechanisms including the bulk of the catalyst. We further show that oxygen intercalation readily occurs under as-grown h-{BN} during ambient air exposure, as is common in further processing, and that this negatively affects the stability of h-{BN} on the catalyst. For extended air exposure Cu oxidation is observed, and upon re-heating in vacuum an oxygen-mediated disintegration of the h-{BN} film via volatile boron oxides occurs. Importantly, this disintegration is catalyst mediated, i.e., occurs at the catalyst/h-{BN} interface and depends on the level of oxygen fed to this interface. In turn, however, deliberate feeding of oxygen during h-{BN} deposition can positively affect control over film morphology. We discuss the implications of these observations in the context of corrosion protection and relate them to challenges in process integration and heterostructure {CVD}.},

Two layers of mesh cover the surface uniformly after high-temperature exposure of the clean rhodium surface to borazine ({HBNH})3. The two layers are offset in such a way as to expose a minimum metal surface area. Hole formation is likely driven by the lattice mismatch of the film and the rhodium substrate. This regular nanostructure is thermally very stable and can serve as a template to organize molecules, as is exemplified by the decoration of the mesh by C60 molecules.},

	abstract = {Hexagonal boron nitride (h-{BN}) has received a great deal of attention as a substrate material for high-performance graphene electronics because it has an atomically smooth surface, lattice constant similar to that of graphene, large optical phonon modes, and a large electrical band gap. Herein, we report the large-scale synthesis of high-quality h-{BN} nanosheets in a chemical vapor deposition ({CVD}) process by controlling the surface morphologies of the copper (Cu) catalysts. It was found that morphology control of the Cu foil is much critical for the formation of the pure h-{BN} nanosheets as well as the improvement of their crystallinity. For the first time, we demonstrate the performance enhancement of {CVD}-based graphene devices with large-scale h-{BN} nanosheets. The mobility of the graphene device on the h-{BN} nanosheets was increased 3 times compared to that without the h-{BN} nanosheets. The on?off ratio of the drain current is 2 times higher than that of the graphene device without h-{BN}. This work suggests that high-quality h-{BN} nanosheets based on {CVD} are very promising for high-performance large-area graphene electronics.},

The use of {LPCVD} allows synthesis of h-{BN} with a controlled number of layers defined by the growth conditions, temperature, time, and gas partial pressure. Furthermore, few-layer h-{BN} was also grown by a sequential growth method, and insights into the growth mechanism are described, thus forming the basis of future growth of h-{BN} by atomic layer epitaxy.},

To examine these fundamental issues we have performed molecular dynamics simulations to record the stress–strain curves in tensile tests and measure Young's modulus, fracture strength and fracture strain in armchair and zigzag directions. Comparing the results obtained at different temperatures and strain rates we have quantified the effects of the two factors on the tensile properties of the h-{BN} nanosheets. The influence of crystal orientation is also examined in the present study. It is found that the h-{BN} nanosheets are basically an anisotropic material whose tensile properties vary substantially with temperature and strain rate. In particular, a yielding platform is observed for the h-{BN} nanomaterial at relatively low temperature.},

	abstract = {Anisotropic triangular graphene monolayers grown on a Ru(0001) surface represent unique two-dimensional templates for creating ordered, large-scale assembly of functional molecules. Using scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy, we demonstrate the selective adsorption and the formation of ordered molecular arrays of iron phthalocyanine and pentacene molecules of different structural symmetries on the graphene/Ru(0001) templates. With in-depth investigations of the molecular adsorption and assembly processes, we reveal the existence of site-specific, lateral electric dipoles (or lateral electric fields) in the epitaxial graphene monolayers and the capability of the dipoles in directing and driving the molecular adsorption and assembly. We show that the lateral dipoles originate from the inhomogeneous distribution of charge due to the epitaxial constraint of graphene on a Ru(0001) surface. The adsorption mechanism is rather general and applicable to similar molecular systems on graphene monolayers formed on other transition metal surfaces.},

Around room temperature, frequent bidirectional conformational switching of individual molecules from concave to convex and vice versa is observed. From the temperature dependence, detailed insights into the energy barriers and entropic contributions of the switching processes are deduced. At 200 K, controlled {STM} tip-induced unidirectional switching is possible, yielding an information storage density of 4.9 ? 1013 bit/inch2. With this contribution we demonstrate that controlled switching of individual molecules at comparably high temperatures is possible and that entropic effects can be a decisive factor in potential molecular devices at these temperatures.},

Thin films were prepared by organic molecular beam epitaxy and subsequent annealing. Our systematic study provides an understanding of the changes of the spectroscopic signature during adsorption and metalation. Specifically, we achieved a detailed peak assignment of the 2H-{TPP} multilayer data of the C1s and the N1s region. After annealing to 420 K both {XPS} and {NEXAFS} show the signatures of a metalloporphyrin, which indicates self-metalation at the porphyrin-substrate interface, resulting in Cu-{TPP}. Furthermore, for 2H-{TPP} monolayer samples we show how the strong influence of the copper surface is reflected in the spectroscopic signatures. Adsorption results in a strongly deformed macrocycle and a quenching of the first {NEXAFS} resonance in the nitrogen edge suggesting electron transfer into the {LUMO}. For Cu-{TPP} the spectroscopic data indicate a reduced interaction of first-layer molecules with the substrate as demonstrated by the relaxed macrocycle geometry.},

Different metal centres incorporated within the tetradentate ligand are key for achieving and regulating vital processes, including reversible axial ligation of adducts, electron transfer, light-harvesting and catalytic transformations. Tailored substituents optimize their performance, dictating their arrangement in specific environments and mediating the assembly of molecular nanoarchitectures. Here we review the current understanding of these species at well-defined interfaces, disclosing exquisite insights into their structural and chemical properties, and also discussing methods by which to manipulate their intramolecular and organizational features. The distinct characteristics arising from the interfacial confinement offer intriguing prospects for molecular science and advanced materials. We assess the role of surface interactions with respect to electronic and physicochemical characteristics, and describe in situ metallation pathways, molecular magnetism, rotation and switching. The engineering of nanostructures, organized layers, interfacial hybrid and bio-inspired systems is also addressed.},

Depending on the deposition conditions, {TAPP} forms three main assemblies, which result from initial submonolayer coverages based on different intermolecular interactions: a close-packed assembly similar to a projection of the bulk structure of {TAPP}, in which the molecules interact mainly through van der Waals ({vDW}) forces and weak hydrogen bonds; a porous copper surface coordination network; and covalently linked molecular chains. The Cu substrate is of crucial importance in determining the structures of the aggregates and available reaction channels on the surface, both in the formation of the porous network for which it provides the Cu atoms for surface metal coordination and in the covalent coupling of the {TAPP} molecules at elevated temperature. Apart from their role in the kinetics of surface transformations, the available metal adatoms may also profoundly influence the thermodynamics of transformations by coordination to the reaction product, as shown in this work for the case of the Cu-decorated covalent poly({TAPP}Cu) chains.},

	abstract = {The unique electronic properties and functional tunability of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons have recently fostered high hopes for their use in flexible, green, portable, and cheap technologies. Most applications require the deposition of thin molecular films onto conductive electrodes. The growth of the first few molecular layers represents a crucial step in the device fabrication since it determines the structure of the molecular film and the energy level alignment of the metal–organic interface. Here, we explore the formation of this interface by analyzing the interplay between reversible molecule–substrate charge transfer, yielding intermolecular repulsion, and van der Waals attractions in driving the molecular assembly. Using a series of ad hoc designed molecules to balance the two effects, we combine scanning tunnelling microscopy with atomistic simulations to study the self-assembly behavior. Our systematic analysis identifies a growth mode characterized by anomalous coarsening that we anticipate to occur in a wide class of metal–organic interfaces and which should thus be considered as integral part of the self-assembly process when depositing a molecule on a conducting surface.},

	abstract = {The on-surface polymerization of 1,3,6,8-tetrabromopyrene (Br4Py) on Cu(111) and Au(111) surfaces under ultrahigh vacuum conditions was investigated by a combination of scanning tunneling microscopy ({STM}), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy ({XPS}) and density functional theory ({DFT}) calculations. Deposition of Br4Py on Cu(111) held at 300 K resulted in a spontaneous debromination reaction, generating the formation of a branched coordination polymer network stabilized by C−Cu−C bonds. After annealing at 473 K, the C−Cu−C bonds were converted to covalent C−C bonds, leading to the formation of a covalently linked molecular network of short oligomers. In contrast, highly ordered self-assembled two-dimensional (2D) patterns stabilized by both Br−Br halogen and Br−H hydrogen bonds were observed upon deposition of Br4Py on Au(111) held at 300 K. Subsequent annealing of the sample at 473 K led to a dissociation of the C−Br bonds and the formation of disordered metal-coordinated molecular networks. Further annealing at 573 K resulted in the formation of covalently linked disordered networks. Importantly, we found that the chosen substrate not only plays an important role as catalyst for the Ullmann reaction, but also influences the formation of different types of intermolecular bonds and thus, determines the final polymer network morphology. {DFT} calculations further support our experimental findings obtained by {STM} and {XPS} and add complementary information on the reaction pathway of Br4Py on the different substrates.},

They represent prime models to enhance the scope of chemical and physical properties of graphene through structural modulation and functionalization. Defined nitrogen doping in nanographenes is particularly attractive due to its potential for increasing the number of $\pi$-electrons, with the possibility of introducing localized antiaromatic ring elements. Herein we present azomethine ylide homocoupling as a strategy to afford internally nitrogen-doped, non-planar {PAH} in solution and planar nanographene on surfaces, with central pyrazine rings. Localized antiaromaticity of the central ring is indicated by optical absorption spectroscopy in conjunction with theoretical calculations. Our strategy opens up methods for chemically tailoring graphene and nanographenes, modified by antiaromatic dopants.},

The moiré superstructure leads to a periodic arrangement of strongly chemisorbed valleys in an otherwise rather flat, weakly physisorbed plane. The best commensurate approximation of the moiré unit cell is (12 × 12) boron nitride cells resting on (11 × 11) substrate cells, which is at variance with several earlier studies. We uncover the existence of two fundamentally different mechanisms of layer formation for hexagonal boron nitride, namely, nucleation and growth as opposed to network formation without nucleation. The different pathways are linked to different distributions of rotational domains, and the latter enables selection of a single orientation only.},
