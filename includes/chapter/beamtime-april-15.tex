Further experiments were carried out to increase the cleanlyness of the h-BN on the polycrystalline copper foil. To reduce the amount of elements coming from the body of the foil it is repeatedly sputtered and annealed to temperatures as high as \SI{800}{\degreeCelsius}. This may have also an improving influence on the grainsize and amount of corrugation. Several attempts have been made which are described in summary below.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{itemize}
 \item After cleaning, the sample is inverstigated in STM. The foil shows a inhommogenous topography, with parts of the sample showing very flat regions (figure \ref{fig:30-31.03}) while others still remain heavily corrugated.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
 \item Before dosage the sample was kept at \SI{800}{\degreeCelsius} for another 10 minutes.
Borazine was dosed for 5 minutes with a pressure of \SI{1e-7}{\milli \bar} with the sample kept at temperatures of \SI{850}{\degreeCelsius}. Afterwards the sample was kept at this temperature for another minute.

\begin{itemize}
 \item The sample was sputtered and annealed several times to temperatures of \SI{800}{\degreeCelsius}. Before the dosage it was held 5 minutes at \SI{750}{\degreeCelsius}. Borazine was dosed with the same pressure as before (\SI{1e-7}{\milli \bar}) but for 1min and at a lower temperature of \SI{750}{\degreeCelsius}. After the preparation the sample was kept at \SI{750}{\degreeCelsius} for another 1 minute. It was cooled down slowly (shown in figure \ref{fig:16.04}.
\end{itemize}

% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% false preparation %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% The next preparation step was started with an intense cleaning step of the copper foil. It was sputtered and annealed to \SI{750}{\degreeCelsius} twice and then kept at \SI{830}{\degreeCelsius} for 2 hours. After this it was sputtered and annealed to \SI{750}{\degreeCelsius} for 1 minute before the borazine was dosed. Unfortunatly the exact amount of borazine could not be determined, the pressure increased to \SI{1e-4}{\milli \bar} for a very short time, so that the dosage was interrupted well below 1 minute. It was again hold at the temperature for another minute and was cooled down very slow (\SIrange{1}{3}{\kelvin \per \second}). The mass spectrum taken after deposition shows the highest peak not where the intact borazine molecule is located but somewhere to lower masses. This indicates that the borazine has decomposed.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{itemize}
 \item The foil was sputtered and annealed 4 times with temperatures of \SI{800}{\degreeCelsius}. Borazine was dosed at \SI{2e-7}{\milli \bar} for \SI{2.5}{\minute}. The sample was kept at this temperature for another 5 minutes after dosing. The sample was cooled down slowly. Figure \ref{fig:15.04} shows some of the grown islands. The copper surface changes upon h-BN growth and the terrace width increases below the h-BN flakes. The typical facetting of the surface vanishes or can at least not be depicted because of the overgrowing h-BN (figure \ref{fig:23.04}). Due to nearby tip formings, the right side of the image is decorated with adsorbats, most likely from the tip itself - they appear as bright white spots in the image.
