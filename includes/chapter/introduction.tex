\begin{itemize}
	\item Science strives to achieve more and more detailed information on matter on the smallest length scales.
	\item Understanding interaction between atoms and molecules resulted in the development of applications in sizes that would never be reached by engineers without applying the knowledge gained by foundational research.
	\item Often these applications are used in our every day life, often behind the scenes without need of the consumer knowing the physical details (efficient catalytic converters in cars, LED lights, self-cleaning window glasses, gas sensors to detect explosives or harmful gas concentrations with very low detection levels (down to low ppm concentrations)).
\end{itemize}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Development of measurement techniques in physics to investigate surfaces at the atomic length scale (STM, AFM, etc)
    \subitem These tools enabled the manipulation of single atoms on surfaces in vacuum \cite{Fe-correl}
    \subitem But it remains a manual process that is not applicable at larger scale
	\item Adsorption of molecules on metallic substrates in vacuum to determine physical properties like electronic structure and assembly.
	\item Inter-molecular structures are created by self-assembly in vacuum
covalent bonds, interaction mediated by van der Waals forces or with adsorbed metal atoms that act as link elements between molecules.
	\item \textbf{Different link techniques result in different structures that are mainly determined by the structure of the molecule.}
	\item metal substrate interacts with the molecules and influences electronic structure and assembly
	\subitem investigation of electronic properties can be decoupled from the substrate by introducing a insulating layer to adsorb the molecules on
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Development of on surface synthesis on metal substrates lead to 2D-materials like \textit{h}-BN that show wide band gap insulating properties
	\item \textbf{Those are used to electronically decouple the molecule from the metal substrate.}
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Molecular chemistry evolved to a point where molecules can be designed on the drawing table and synthesized with demanded properties
	\subitem Assembly at atomic level predetermined by synthesis
	\item \textbf{Regular molecular structures are used to benchmark theoretical calculations that can be compared to measurements on the atomic level}
