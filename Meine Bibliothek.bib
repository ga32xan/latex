The significant additive concentration gradient in features, resulting in a selective Cu dissolution rate within features, is explored as a major mechanism that yields such electrolytes with high planarization efficiency. Moreover, another additive, polyethylene glycol as a suppressor, is also employed to reduce oxygen bubbling on polished films. Consequently, a smooth surface with a complete step height elimination is obtained in a 70 μm trench after electropolishing. © 2003 The Electrochemical Society. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The primary interactions of low-energy x-rays within condensed matter, viz. photoabsorption and coherent scattering, have been described for photon energies outside the absorption threshold regions by using atomic scattering factors. The atomic scattering factors may be accurately determined from the atomic photoabsorption cross sections using modified Kramers-Kronig dispersion relations. From a synthesis of the currently available experimental data and recent theoretical calculations for photoabsorption, the angle-independent, forward-scattering components of the atomic scattering factors have been thus semiempirically determined and tabulated here for 92 elements and for the region 50-30,000 {eV}. Atomic scattering factors for all angles of coherent scattering and at the higher photon energies are obtained from these tabulated forward-scattering values by adding a simple angle-dependent form-factor correction. The incoherent scattering contributions that become significant for the light elements at the higher photon energies are similarly determined. The basic x-ray interaction relations that are used in applied x-ray physics are presented here in terms of the atomic scattering factors. The bulk optical constants are also related to the atomic scattering factors. These atomic and optical relations are applied to the detailed calculation of the reflectivity characteristics of a series of practical x-ray mirror, multilayer, and crystal monochromators. Comparisons of the results of this semiempirical, "atomic-like" description of x-ray interactions for the low-energy region with those of experiment and ab initio theory are presented.},

	abstract = {Atomically smooth hexagonal boron nitride (h-{BN}) layers have very useful properties and thus potential applications for protective coatings, deep ultraviolet ({DUV}) emitters, and as a dielectric for nanoelectronics devices. In this paper, we report on the growth of h-{BN} by a low-pressure chemical vapor deposition ({LPCVD}) process using diborane and ammonia as the gas precursors. The use of {LPCVD} allows synthesis of h-{BN} with a controlled number of layers defined by the growth conditions, temperature, time, and gas partial pressure. Furthermore, few-layer h-{BN} was also grown by a sequential growth method, and insights into the growth mechanism are described, thus forming the basis of future growth of h-{BN} by atomic layer epitaxy.},

Monolayer h-{BN}, so-called ?white graphene?, has been isolated from bulk {BN} and could be useful as a complementary two-dimensional dielectric substrate for graphene electronics. Here we report the large area synthesis of h-{BN} films consisting of two to five atomic layers, using chemical vapor deposition. These atomic films show a large optical energy band gap of 5.5 {eV} and are highly transparent over a broad wavelength range. The mechanical properties of the h-{BN} films, measured by nanoindentation, show 2D elastic modulus in the range of 200?500 N/m, which is corroborated by corresponding theoretical calculations.},

	abstract = {Hexagonal boron nitride (h-{BN}) is very attractive for many applications, particularly, as protective coating, dielectric layer/substrate, transparent membrane, or deep ultraviolet emitter. In this work, we carried out a detailed investigation of h-{BN} synthesis on Cu substrate using chemical vapor deposition ({CVD}) with two heating zones under low pressure ({LP}). Previous atmospheric pressure ({AP}) {CVD} syntheses were only able to obtain few layer h-{BN} without a good control on the number of layers. In contrast, under {LPCVD} growth, monolayer h-{BN} was synthesized and time-dependent growth was investigated. It was also observed that the morphology of the Cu surface affects the location and density of the h-{BN} nucleation. Ammonia borane is used as a {BN} precursor, which is easily accessible and more stable under ambient conditions than borazine. The h-{BN} films are characterized by atomic force microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and electron energy loss spectroscopy analyses. Our results suggest that the growth here occurs via surface-mediated growth, which is similar to graphene growth on Cu under low pressure. These atomically thin layers are particularly attractive for use as atomic membranes or dielectric layers/substrates for graphene devices.},

Herein, we report the large-scale synthesis of high-quality h-{BN} nanosheets in a chemical vapor deposition ({CVD}) process by controlling the surface morphologies of the copper (Cu) catalysts. It was found that morphology control of the Cu foil is much critical for the formation of the pure h-{BN} nanosheets as well as the improvement of their crystallinity. For the first time, we demonstrate the performance enhancement of {CVD}-based graphene devices with large-scale h-{BN} nanosheets. The mobility of the graphene device on the h-{BN} nanosheets was increased 3 times compared to that without the h-{BN} nanosheets. The on?off ratio of the drain current is 2 times higher than that of the graphene device without h-{BN}. This work suggests that high-quality h-{BN} nanosheets based on {CVD} are very promising for high-performance large-area graphene electronics.},

This metalation reaction starts at about 400 K and was investigated at various temperatures up to 500 K. At room temperature, adsorbed 2HTPP adopts an orientation with the molecular plane parallel to the substrate; the same holds for its reaction product {CuTPP} after annealing to 400 K. In contrast, annealing at 450 K yields a tilted orientation of {CuTPP}, as indicated by {STM} and supported by C 1s {XPS} shifts and changes in the Cu(111) surface state. Subsequent annealing at 500 K restores a flat-lying orientation; however, the appearance of the complex in {STM} images differs from the original appearance of {CuTPP}. In summary, 2HTPP undergoes three irreversible transformations upon annealing on Cu(111), a metalation reaction to {CuTPP} followed by two intramolecular structural changes.},

Thin films were prepared by organic molecular beam epitaxy and subsequent annealing. Our systematic study provides an understanding of the changes of the spectroscopic signature during adsorption and metalation. Specifically, we achieved a detailed peak assignment of the 2H-{TPP} multilayer data of the C1s and the N1s region. After annealing to 420 K both {XPS} and {NEXAFS} show the signatures of a metalloporphyrin, which indicates self-metalation at the porphyrin-substrate interface, resulting in Cu-{TPP}. Furthermore, for 2H-{TPP} monolayer samples we show how the strong influence of the copper surface is reflected in the spectroscopic signatures. Adsorption results in a strongly deformed macrocycle and a quenching of the first {NEXAFS} resonance in the nitrogen edge suggesting electron transfer into the {LUMO}. For Cu-{TPP} the spectroscopic data indicate a reduced interaction of first-layer molecules with the substrate as demonstrated by the relaxed macrocycle geometry.},

Electron spin resonance ({ESR}) analysis indicated a partially resolved five-line spectrum, suggesting that the label was attached to at least two different binding sites. Using specific blocking reagents prior to spin labeling, the two binding sites were attributed to the sulfhydryl group of beta-93 (immobile) and the alpha-amino group of the N-terminal valines (mobile). The relative motion of the spin at one set of binding sites was restricted regardless of the state of ligation and {pH}, while the motion at the other site showed dependence on those parameters, e.g. the spin-labeled N-terminal ends of deoxyhemoglobin have restricted motion at all {pH} ranges studied, while those of oxyhemoglobin are relatively free to move at the basic {pH} range, but become more restricted in the acidic {pH} range.},

Colored, particulate hide powder-azure, membrane fractions and soluble proteins such as hemoglobin, casein or albumin were susceptible to hydrolysis by the membraneous protease. Partial purification of the enzyme was accomplished through disc-gel electrophoresis on polyacrylamide in the presence of 0.25\% positively charged detergents like cetyltrimethylammonium bromide. An alkaline protease ({pH} 7.4) with properties similar to those of the erythrocyte enzyme was found in leucocytes. The similarity between the properties of the leucocytic and erythrocytic proteases and the correlation of the activity in erythrocyte membranes with content of white cells in these preparations, suggest that enzymatic activities in the contaminating leucocytes are responsible for the activity of membraneous proteases in erythrocytes.},

	abstract = {The erythrocruorin of the leech Haemopis grandis possessed an S20,w of 57 S at neutral {pH}, its isoelectric point at {pH} 6.0 and exhibited a slightly sigmoid oxygenation curve with n approximately 2.1 and P50 = 11.2 mm at {pH} 7.4. A minimum molecular weight of 24000 +/- 1500 per heme group was determined from the iron and heme contents, 0.22 +/- 0.01 and 2.73 +/- 0.14 weight \%, respectively. The subunit composition of the erythrocruorin was investigated using gel filtration in sodium dodecyl sulfate and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate at neutral {pH}. Haemopis erythrocruorin dissociated in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate into four subunits (1 through 4) possessing molecular weights of about 27000, 23000, 21000 and 13500, respectively. When the erythrocruorin was reduced with mercaptoethanol prior to sodium dodecyl sulfate electrophoresis, three subunits were observed, possessing molecular weights of about 13000 (I), 16500 ({II}) and 28000 ({III}). Sodium dodecyl sulfate electrophoresis of the isolated subunits 1 through 4 showed that subunit I was provided by subunits 1 and 4, subunit {II} was provided by subunit 1 and subunit {III} was provided by both subunit 2 and subunit 3. Haemopis erythrocruorin thus appeared to consist of at least five different polypeptide chains. It is likely that not all of the constituent polypeptide chains were associated each with a heme group. The shape of the Haemopis erythrocruorin observed by electron microscopy appeared to be consistent with the two-tiered hexagonal array characteristic of annelid erythrocruorins and chlorocruorins.},

	abstract = {1. Fragments of isolated rat liver plasma membrane possess a ribonuclease activity which at {pH} 7.8 in the presence of 10 {mM} {EDTA} can digest polyuridylic acid (poly(U)) and polycytidylic acid (poly(C)) but not polyadenylic acid (poly(A)) and polyguanylic acid (poly(G)). Under these conditions, the membrane preparation does not degrade native or denatured {DNA}. 2. The products of the reaction with poly(U) (10 {mM} {EDTA} present) can be separated on {DEAE}-Sephadex into oligonucleotides of increasing chain length. Most of the products are di- to hexa-nucleotides which contain terminal 3'-phosphate groups. 3. When {EDTA} is not present ({pH} 7.8 or 8.8) the plasma membrane preparation degrades both poly(A) and poly(U). With poly(A) the product is all nucleoside while with poly(U) as substrate most of the product is nucleoside, but also some oligonucleotides are produced. 4. The ribonuclease releases acid soluble products very slowly from high concentrations of poly(U) (mg/ml). 5. Uridine trinucleotide with and without a terminal 3'-phosphate group is degraded by rat liver plasma membrane. The trinucleotide diphosphate is rapidly hydrolyzed to nucleoside while the trinucleotide itself is slowly digested and yields intermediate products, including nucleoside.},

The resulting complex, Sepharose-Myosin, possesses adenosine triphosphatase activity and is relatively stable for long periods of time. Under optimal binding conditions, approximately 33\% of the specific {ATPase} activity of the bound myosin is retained. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of polypeptides released from denatured Sepharose-Myosin indicates that 85\% of the myosin is attached to the agarose beads through the heavy chains and the remainder through the light chains, in agreement with predictions of binding and release based upon either the lysine contents or molecular weights of themyosin subunits. The adenosine triphosphatase of the immobilized myosin has been investigated under conditions of varying {pH}, ionic strength, and cation concentration. The {ATPase} profiles of immobilized myosin are quite similar to those for free myosin, however subtle differences are found. The Sepharose-Myosin {ATPase} is not as sensitive as myosin to alterations in salt concentration and the apparent {KM} is approximately two-fold higher than that of myosin. These differences are probably due to chemical modification in the region of the attachment site(s) to the agarose beads and hydration and diffusion limitations imposed by the polymeric agarose matrix.},

The oxygen equilibrium curve of the whole blood haemolysate containing Hbs A and Tak was close to that of Hb A at the top of the curve, while the bottom of the curve greatly deviated from the latter, indicative of small if any interaction between Hb A and Tak during oxygenation.},

	abstract = {Suitable templates to steer the formation of nanostructure arrays on surfaces are indispensable in nanoscience. Recently, atomically thin sp2-bonded layers such as graphene or boron nitride ({BN}) grown on metal supports have attracted considerable interest due to their potential geometric corrugation guiding the positioning of atoms, metallic clusters or molecules. Here, we demonstrate three specific functions of a geometrically smooth, but electronically corrugated, sp2/metal interface, namely, {BN}/Cu(111), qualifying it as a unique nanoscale template. As functional adsorbates we employed free-base porphine (2H?P), a prototype tetrapyrrole compound, and tetracyanoquinodimethane ({TCNQ}), a well-known electron acceptor. (i) The electronic moirons of the {BN}/Cu(111) interface trap both 2H?P and {TCNQ}, steering self-organized growth of arrays with extended molecular assemblies. (ii) We report an effective decoupling of the trapped molecules from the underlying metal support by the {BN}, which allows for a direct visualization of frontier orbitals by scanning tunneling microscopy ({STM}). (iii) The lateral molecular positioning in the superstructured surface determines the energetic level alignment; i.e., the energy of the frontier orbitals, and the electronic gap are tunable.},

The h-{BN} grows freely and spontaneously to form triangular domains on the Cu (100) plane. The triangular domains are prone to be parallel to each other on the copper substrate. The h-{BN} domains grow by extending in the normal direction of the triangle and form a large thin film by joining together. Both the size and coverage rate on Cu foils are well controlled by tuning the amount of ammonia borane.},

	abstract = {Molecular dynamic simulations are performed to investigate the mechanical properties of hybrid graphene and hexagonal boron nitrogen (h-{BN}) sheet with the concentration of {BN} ranging from 0\% to 100\%. We find that Young's modulus of the hybrid sheet decreases with increasing concentration of {BN}, irrespective of {BN} shapes and distributions. However, a little mixing of h-{BN} and graphene can result in a noticeable drop in the yield strength of the hybrid sheet. In addition, the hybrid sheet exhibits strong plasticity behaviour during the tensile loading, which is not observed in pure graphene and {BN} sheets. We further demonstrate that this behaviour can be interpreted by the fact that the interface between the {BN} domain and graphene governs the failure mechanism of the hybrid sheet, which can be approximated by the classical Griffith model. Our results suggest that the mechanical properties of the hybrid graphene–{BN} sheet should be considered carefully when evaluating its whole performance when it is used in bandgap-engineered applications such as electronics and optics.},

For comparison, the adsorption of atomic oxygen on highly oriented pyrolytic graphite has been studied under the same conditions. Graphene oxidation predominantly occurs through the formation of epoxy groups and causes atomic-scale buckling of the graphene lattice, as evidenced by an sp2-to-sp3 bonding transformation. The different parts of the graphene/metal moiré superstructure show different oxidation dynamics, with the initial formation of epoxy groups in the more bonding “pores”. Upon O adsorption, the nearest C neighbors of epoxy groups get engaged in a stronger bonding with the substrate. As a result, the pores of the graphene mesh become attracted and effectively pinned to the substrate by the O atoms. A limited intercalation of oxygen under graphene is also probable. Annealing of the samples after oxygen exposure only partially recovers the original graphene structure and results in the formation of a dense pattern of quasi-periodic, nanometer-sized holes. Both the selective oxidization and the hole formation can be exploited for selective functionalization or tuning of the electronic properties.},

	title = {Water Adsorption and Ion Induced Defect Formation: A Comparative Study of Graphene and Noble Metal Surfaces},
	url = {http://kups.ub.uni-koeln.de/5227/},
	abstract = {The thesis at hand is subdivided into parts. In the first part we study the thermodynamics and structure of water adsorption on graphene and noble metal surfaces. The second part of this thesis is dedicated to surface damage caused by grazing incidence ion bombardment of graphene on Ir(111). Both parts are completed by a comparison of the various sample systems. We study the structure and stability of the first water layer on Pt(111) by variable temperature scanning tunneling microscopy. Two structures observed previously by diffraction techniques are imaged for coverages at or close to completion of the wetting layer. At 140K only a (\${\textbackslash}sqrt\$37x\${\textbackslash}sqrt\$37)R25.3? superstructure can be established, while at 130K also a (\${\textbackslash}sqrt\$39x\${\textbackslash}sqrt\$39)R16.1? superstructure with slightly higher molecular density is formed. In the temperature range under concern the superstructures reversibly transform into each other by slight changes in coverage through adsorption or desorption. The superstructures exhibit a complex pattern of molecules in different geometries. We find that a high Pt step edge density considerably increases the long range order of the equilibrium superstructures, presumably due to the capability of step edges to trap residual adsorbates from the surface. Passivating the step edges with {CO} or preparing a flat metal surface leads to the formation of disordered structures, which still show the same structural elements as the ordered ones. Coadsorption of Xe and {CO} proves that the water layer covers the metal surface completely. Moreover, we determine the two-dimensional crystal structure of Xe on top of the chemisorbed water layer which exhibits a Xe-Xe distance close to the one in bulk Xe and a rotation angle of 90? between the close-packed directions of Xe and the close-packed directions of the underlying water layer. {CO} is shown to replace H2O on the Pt(111) surface as has been deduced previously. Finally, a so far not understood restructuring of the adlayer by an increased tunneling current has been observed. We present experimental data regarding the wetting behaviour and structure formation of water on Ir(111). Studying the thermodynamics of water adsorption and pointing out the possibility to form a wetting layer, we perform a coverage dependent analysis of the sub-monolayer regime. We show that water molecules form planar, polar clusters upon adsorption. A continuous water layer forms out of the cluster phase for {\textbackslash}ensuremath{\textbackslash}Theta{\textbackslash}ensuremath{\textgreater}0.5ML. The molecular arrangement is nearly identical to the wetting layer observed on Pt(111). The water growth mode changes from wetting to non-wetting for {\textbackslash}ensuremath{\textbackslash}Theta{\textbackslash}ensuremath{\textgreater}1ML as the closed water monolayer is hydrophobic. For both Pt(111) and Ir(111), we demonstrate that tunneling of electrons into the antibonding state or from the bonding state of H2O leads to dissociation of the molecules and a corresponding reordering of the adlayer into a (\${\textbackslash}sqrt\$3x\${\textbackslash}sqrt\$3)R30?-structure. An analogous study is carried out for water adsorption on a graphene covered Ir(111) surface. We show that water dewets graphene at 20K and forms three-dimensional, electronically insulating clusters aligned in the Gr?Ir(111) moiré for {\textbackslash}ensuremath{\textbackslash}Theta=3ML. Higher coverage results in coalescence and the formation of an amorphous adlayer. The occurence of this structure can be promoted by an increase of the adsorption temperature above 100K. By combining ion beam experiments and atomistic simulations we study the production of defects in graphene on Ir(111) under grazing incidence of low energy noble gas ions. Low fluences are chosen to make the damage patterns of individual ions visible. We demonstrate that the ions are channeled in between graphene and the substrate, giving rise to chains of vacancy clusters, and control the defect structure via tuning of the bombardment parameters. Combining our experiments on thermal stability of defects and density functional theory calculations, we discuss the atomic structure of defects in detail and show that their edges are bending down towards the substrate to saturate dangling bonds by the metal surface. With the onset of vacancy cluster mobility around 800K, the vacancies sense formation energy differences within the graphene moiré supercell, which paves the way towards the formation of a graphene nanomesh. In order to realize this struture a transition from isolated ion impacts towards a defect density in the magnitude of one per moiré cell has to be accomplished. We discuss the sample morphology and thermal evolution of the damage patterns following prolonged ion exposure. We show that the temperature during bombardment is of great importance to drive the carbon vacancies to these sites, where the formation energy is lowest, and thus allow for an immediate reconstruction of the graphene layer. Elaborating appropriate parameters for the formation of a high quality nanomesh regarding ion energy and fluence, we give an experimental realization of this structure.},

We consider dopants as boron and nitrogen atoms in graphene and carbon atoms in boron nitride plane. We find that the band width of graphene increases in the presence of impurity atoms. Furthermore, appearing a finite density of states at zero energy due to doping by both boron and nitrogen atoms leads to metallic property in the graphene sheet. Our results also show that doping by carbon reduces the band gap of the boron nitride system. In high concentration of carbon atoms, the density of states of boron nitride plane becomes similar to that of graphene sheet, resulting in semimetallic behavior. We also recognize that the van-Hove singularities in the density of states of both systems are broadened. Moreover, all effects of impurities on their density of states depend on doping concentrations.},

Similar to the structure of graphene, two-dimensional semiconductors are its two-dimensional and isostructural counterparts based on the typical layer-structured semiconductors, such as boron nitride (h-{BN}) and transition metal dichalcogenides (e.g. {MoS}2 and {WS}2), whose layers are bound by weak van der Waals forces. Unlike the semi-metal features of graphene, the two-dimensional semiconductors are natural semiconductors with thicknesses on the atomic scale. When one of the dimensions is extremely reduced, the two-dimensional semiconductors exhibit some unique properties, such as a transition from indirect to direct semiconductor properties, and hence have great potential for applications in electronics, energy storage, sensors, catalysis and composites, which arise both from the dimension-reduced effect and from the modified electronic structure. In this feature article, recent developments in the synthesis, properties and applications of two-dimensional semiconductors are discussed. The reported virtues and novelties of two-dimensional semiconductors are highlighted and the current problems in their developing process are clarified, in addition to their challenges and future prospects.},

At low temperature (T = 170 K), molecular borazine adsorption occurs with the plane of the benzene-like ring parallel to the substrate. Dehydrogenation is observed at temperatures higher than 250 K and extends up to 900 K, with a maximum H2 desorption rate around 300 K. Besides dehydrogenation, room temperature adsorption of borazine leads to the formation of atomic and molecular fragments due to the break-up of part of the {BN} bonds. The epitaxial growth of h-{BN} starts at temperature higher than 1000 K where an extended and long-range ordered layer is obtained. The presence of a corrugation in the h-{BN} layer with moiré periodicity of (13 x 13)/(12 x 12) {BN}/Ir unit cell is reflected in the double component structure of the B 1s and N 1s core level spectra.},

	abstract = {The adsorption of hydrogen, ethylene, acetylene, cyclohexane and benzene was studied on both the (111) and stepped [6(111)x(100)] crystal surfaces of iridium. The techniques used were low energy electron diffraction, Auger electron spectroscopy, and thermal desorption mass spectrometry. At 30°C, acetylene, ethylene and benzene are adsorbed with a sticking probability near unity. The sticking probability of cyclohexane is less than 0.1 on both surfaces. Heating the (111) surface above 800°C, in the presence of the hydrocarbons, results in the formation of an ordered carbonaceous overlayer with a diffraction pattern corresponding to a (9x9) surface structure. No indication for ordering of the carbonaceous residue was found on the stepped iridium surface in these experimental conditions. The hydrocarbon molecules form only poorly ordered surface structures on both iridium surfaces when the adsorption is carried out at 30°C. Benzene is the only gas that can be desorbed from the surfaces in large amounts by heating. Ethylene remains largely on the surface, only a few percent is removed by heating while acetylene and cyclohexane cannot be desorbed at all. When adsorption is carried out at 30°C and the crystal is subsequently flashed to high temperature, hydrogen is liberated from the surface. The hydrogen desorption spectra from the iridium surfaces exposed to C2H4, C2H2, or C6H6 exhibit two hydrogen desorption peaks, one around 200°C and the second around 350°C. The temperatures where these peaks appear vary slightly with the type of hydrocarbon. The relative intensities of these two peaks depend strongly on the surface used. Arguments are presented that decomposition of the hydrocarbon molecules (C-H bond breaking nd possibly also C-C bond breaking) occurs easier on the stepped iridium surface than on the (111) surface. Hydrogen is desorbed at a higher temperature from an iridium surface possessing a high density of surface imperfections than from a perfect iridium (111) surface. The results are compared with those obtained previously on similar crystal surfaces of platinum. It appears that C-H bond breaking occurs more easily on iridium than on platinum.},

The results are compared with those for the Au/Rh(1\&\#xa0;1\&\#xa0;1) and Au/h-{BN}/Pt(1\&\#xa0;1\&\#xa0;1) interfaces. It has been found that on clean Rh(1\&\#xa0;1\&\#xa0;1) substrate gold starts to grow two-dimensionally (2D), while in the presence of a h-{BN} interlayer it forms islands from the very beginning. In the case of flat h-{BN} monolayer (on Pt) these islands are essentially three-dimensional (3D) and irregular in size. In contrast, on the h-{BN} nanomesh (on Rh) gold grows initially as regular islands (predominantly 2D), probably filling the pores of the nanomesh. In addition, the evolution of the Au islands in h-{BN}/Rh(1\&\#xa0;1\&\#xa0;1) upon annealing has been investigated with core level photoemission and X-ray absorption. The annealing at temperatures between {RT} and 300\&\#xa0;°C does not affect the 2D character of Au islands, while further increase in temperature results in formation of 3D islands. At higher temperatures (above 500\&\#xa0;°C), the gold atoms diffuse through h-{BN} into the Rh substrate and/or desorb from the surface. However, they do not influence the chemical bond between rhodium and h-{BN} at any stage of annealing: the nanomesh remains intact.},

There has already been some research on manipulating individual sheets on {HOPG} surfaces with scanning probe microscope tips; such sheets were obtained either accidentally or with a less controllable indenting technique. Here we present a different approach, which is more reliable and controllable. The {HOPG} surface was first patterned to create an array of small graphite islands by reactive ion etching of the {HOPG} surface with an oxygen plasma. These islands were then manipulated with an atomic force microscope tip. Carbon nanotubes represent a promising material for nanotechnology and can be considered as a graphene sheet rolled into a seamless cylinder. While carbon nanotubes are synthesized successfully with laser ablation, carbon arc, or chemical vapour deposition techniques, we speculate that it might be possible, by the controlled fabrication of graphene sheets, to form nanotubes or other novel motifs of use for nanotechnology.},

The prediction of rate and diffusion coefficients based on molecular dynamics, transition-state theory, stochastic diffusion theory, and quantum mechanics is discussed, and the success of these theoretical approaches in representing experimental observation is examined. Consideration is also given to the effects of lateral interactions between adsorbates and to the ability of lattice-gas models to provide a representation of the dependences of rate and diffusion coefficients on adsorbate coverage. Finally, the utility of continuum and Monte Carlo models for describing the kinetics of complex surface processes in terms of elementary processes is addressed.},

	abstract = {Graphene and hexagonal boron nitride (h-{BN}) have similar crystal structures with a lattice constant difference of only 2\%. However, graphene is a zero-bandgap semiconductor with remarkably high carrier mobility at room temperature1, 2, 3, whereas an atomically thin layer of h-{BN}4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 is a dielectric with a wide bandgap of 5.9 {eV}. Accordingly, if precise two-dimensional domains of graphene and h-{BN} can be seamlessly stitched together, hybrid atomic layers with interesting electronic applications could be created10. Here, we show that planar graphene/h-{BN} heterostructures can be formed by growing graphene in lithographically patterned h-{BN} atomic layers. Our approach can create periodic arrangements of domains with size ranging from tens of nanometres to millimetres. The resulting graphene/h-{BN} atomic layers can be peeled off the growth substrate and transferred to various platforms including flexible substrates. We also show that the technique can be used to fabricate two-dimensional devices, such as a split closed-loop resonator that works as a bandpass filter.},

	abstract = {Using molecular dynamics, nudged elastic band and modified analytic embedded atom methods, the self-diffusion dynamics properties of palladium atomic clusters up to seven atoms on the Pd (1 1 1) surface have been studied at temperatures ranging from 300 to 1000 K. The simulation time varies from 20 to 75 ns according to the cluster sizes and the temperature ranges. The heptamer and trimer are more stable than the other neighboring clusters. The diffusion coefficients of the clusters are derived from the mean square displacement of the cluster's mass-center, and the diffusion prefactors D 0 and activation energies E a are derived from the Arrhenius relation. The activation energy of the clusters increases with the increasing atom number in the clusters, especially for Pd 6 to Pd 7 . The analysis of trajectories shows the noncompact clusters diffuse by the local diffusion mechanism but the compact clusters diffuse mainly by the whole gliding mechanism, and some static energy barriers of the diffusion modes are calculated. From Pd 2 to Pd 6 , the prefactors are in the range of the standard value 10 −3 cm 2 s −1 , and the prefactor of Pd 7 cluster is 2 orders of magnitude greater than that of the single Pd adatom because of a large number of nonequivalent diffusion processes. The heptamer can be the nucleus in the room temperature range according to nucleation theory.},

Comparing the results obtained at different temperatures and strain rates we have quantified the effects of the two factors on the tensile properties of the h-{BN} nanosheets. The influence of crystal orientation is also examined in the present study. It is found that the h-{BN} nanosheets are basically an anisotropic material whose tensile properties vary substantially with temperature and strain rate.

Here, the nucleation and growth of h-{BN} monolayer on Ru(0001) surface are investigated using scanning tunneling microscopy with a view toward understanding the process of defect formation on a strongly interacted interface. In contrast to homoelemental bonding in graphene, the heteroelemental nature of h-{BN} gives rise to growth fronts with elemental polarity. This can have consequences in the different stages of film growth, from the nucleation of h-{BN} magic clusters and their sintering to form compact triangular islands to the growth of patchwork mosaic monolayer with a high density of misfit boundaries. The parallel alignment of triangular islands on the same terrace produces translational fault lines when growth fronts merge, while antiparallel alignment of islands on adjacent terraces produces non-bonded fault lines between domains terminated by like atoms. With these insights into the generation of void defects and fault lines at grain boundaries, we demonstrate a strategy to obtain high-quality h-{BN} monolayer film based on step flow growth.},

	title = {Interaction of Graphene and Templated Cluster Arrays with {CO}, H2, and O2},
	url = {http://kups.ub.uni-koeln.de/5159/},
	abstract = {Interaction of graphene and templated cluster arrays with {CO}, H2 and O2 was studied by means of scanning tunneling microscopy ({STM}) and X-ray photoemission spectroscopy ({XPS}). The experimental data was complemented by ab initio density functional theory ({DFT}) calculations. As a prerequisite for studies of gas interaction, the binding mechanism of the clusters to graphene, as well as the growth and structure of Pt clusters, was investigated in detail. The formation of cluster lattices on graphene on Ir(111) has been explained by graphene rehybridization. This {DFT} picture was tested by comparing calculated core level spectra to {XPS} measurements. For pristine graphene, {DFT} and {XPS} agree on a 140 {meV} modulation of the C 1s core level shifts ({CLS}), which correlates with the height modulation of the graphene layer above the Ir surface. With Pt clusters adsorbed, measured Pt 4f {CLS} of the adsorbed clusters also support the calculations. The modulation of the C 1s spectrum is strengthened with clusters adsorbed, and C atoms both under and in the vicinity of the Pt clusters are experimentally distinguished as a broad shoulder of positive C 1s {CLS}. The calculations suggest that the sp2 to sp3 rehybridization of graphene displaces the involved C atoms closer to the Ir(111) surface, implying chemical bond formation. The signature of these bonds in the Ir 4f spectrum was identified. The growth of Pt clusters, their structure, and their interaction with the graphene layer was studied as a function of Pt coverage. {STM} measurements revealed that once Pt clusters are two-layered, their further growth is restricted to two dimensions. The threshold for sintering was found to be at 0.75ML Pt, so that the upper size limit for Pt clusters arranged in a lattice is 65 atoms. The cluster-graphene interaction, as well as the graphene-Ir surface interaction was investigated with spectra of the C 1s and the Ir 4f regions, respectively. It was found that the related components, namely the C 1s shoulder and the Ir interface component, agree regarding their relative intensities. Combining these results, schematic representations of the clusters and their binding geometry with the graphene layer was derived. Pt cluster arrays were tested for their stability with respect to {CO} gas exposure. Cluster stability and adsorption-induced processes were analyzed as a function of cluster size. Small clusters containing fewer than 10 atoms are unstable upon {CO} adsorption. They sinter through Smoluchowski ripening ? cluster diffusion and coalescence ? rather than the frequently reported Ostwald ripening mediated by metal-adsorbate complexes. Larger clusters remain immobile upon {CO} adsorption, but become more three-dimensional. An implication of the {CO}-induced cluster mobility is the sensitivity of Pt cluster array growth to the {CO} background pressure. In order to generalize the results, the study was extended to the adsorption of other gases (H2, O2) on Pt clusters, as well as to the adsorption of {CO} on other metal clusters (Ir, Au). The temperature, time and flake-size-dependent intercalation phases of oxygen underneath graphene on Ir(111) formed upon exposure to molecular oxygen were studied. Through the applied pressure of molecular oxygen, the atomic oxygen created on the bare Ir terraces is driven underneath the graphene flakes. The importance of substrate steps and of the unbinding of graphene flake edges from the substrate for the intercalation is identified. Using {CO} titration to selectively remove oxygen from the bare Ir terraces, the energetics of intercalation were uncovered. Cluster decoration techniques were used as an efficient tool to visualize intercalation processes in real space. To give an outlook, the study was extended to the intercalation of hydrogen. Intercalation of graphene often leads doping of graphene. Comparing {XPS} and angular resolved photoemission spectroscopy ({ARPES}) data for various systems, it was found that the Dirac point and the C 1s core level shift in the same direction. These shifts can be described in terms of a rigid band model and the C 1s core level shift may be used to estimate the level of doping. It was found that graphene?Ir(111)is p-doped by H and O intercalation, whereas it is n-doped after Eu intercalation. The graphene layer is also doped by Pt and Ir clusters on top of it. The smallest clusters n-dope the graphene by charge spill-out. The largest Pt coverage results in a slight p-doping of the graphene layer. When Pt clusters coalesce upon {CO} exposure, the level of doping is reduced.},

	title = {Submonolayer growth of cobalt on metallic and insulating surfaces studied by scanning tunneling microscopy and kinetic Monte-Carlo simulations},
	abstract = {Submonolayer epitaxial growth is obtained by the deposition of less than a complete layer of atoms on a single crystal surface. It is of fundamental interest for industrial applications (e.g. in the semiconductor industry) as well as from the point of view of basic research. For example, it is known that nanometer-sized atomic structures (nanostructures) exhibit remarkable physical and chemical properties which can differ greatly from those of bulk matter. In order to investigate these properties, it is often necessary to create large quantities of well defined and possibly spatially ordered nanostructures. One way to achieve this result is self-organized growth where one deposits atoms on a clean crystalline surface and lets the growth process evolve freely. Here, nanostructures result from the atomic diffusion and aggregation processes taking place at the surface. Understanding the exact nature of these processes is of ongoing interest in the field of nanostructure growth. In this thesis we report about submonolayer growth experiments of the ferromagnetic transition metal cobalt. Cobalt was chosen because it exhibits remarkable magnetic properties. These experiments were performed in an ultra-high vacuum chamber and molecular beam epitaxy was used to grow the nanostructures. Observations of the surface were made using a variable-temperature scanning tunneling microscope ({STM}). In order to get a better understanding of the atomic processes happening at the surface, we developed two adapted computational simulation methods. Kinetic Monte-Carlo ({KMC}) simulations were used to get an atomistic picture of the surface while mean field rate equations were integrated numerically to yield cluster densities. We study the growth of cobalt on three different surfaces. By depositing Co on a clean Pt(111) crystal surface, we observe that the platinum surface reconstructs by forming star-shaped partial dislocations for sample temperatures above 180 K (-93Â°C). We also observe that island densities deviate from predictions of all known models towards higher values for these same temperatures. By simulation we are able to show that insertion of Co into the topmost platinum layer creates a repulsive network of dislocations. We show that these dislocations act as diffusion inhibiting barriers and thus influence the island density by constraining the free movement of atoms at the surface. We also show that the Co dimer and trimer diffuse on Pt(111) before dissociating and are able to extract corresponding activation barriers. We also study the deposition of Co on a Ru(0001) surface which shows a more conventional temperature dependence. By comparing simulation and experiment we extract all relevant diffusion activation barriers and show that at high temperatures the Co dimer and trimer dissociate. Finally, we investigate the growth of Co on the hexagonal boron nitride superlattice which forms on a Rh(111) surface. On this surface Co clusters form three-dimensional hemispherical dots. We show how the substrate corrugation influences diffusion of Co atoms and that clusters up to the size of the pentamer can diffuse. By simulation, we also extract the relevant migrations and desorption barriers.},

Here, we report our first-principles calculations on the stable configurations and electronic structures of graphdiyne doped with boron–nitrogen ({BN}) units. We show that {BN} unit prefers to replace the sp-hybridized carbon atoms in the chain at a low doping rate, forming linear {BN} atomic chains between carbon hexagons. At a high doping rate, {BN} units replace first the carbon atoms in the hexagons and then those in the chains. A comparison study indicates that these substitution reactions may be easier to occur than those on graphene which composes purely of sp2-hybridized carbon atoms. With the increase of {BN} component, the band gap increases first gradually and then abruptly, corresponding to the transition between the two substitution motifs. The direct-band gap feature is intact in these {BN}-doped graphdiyne regardless the doping rate. A simple tight-binding model is proposed to interpret the origin of the band gap opening behaviors. Such wide-range band gap modification in graphdiyne may find applications in nanoscaled electronic devices and solar cells.},

For tubes larger than 9.5 Å in diameter, the lowest conduction band is predicted to be free-electron-like with electronic charge density localized inside the tube. For these tubes, this band is at constant energy above the top of the valence band. Consequently, contrarily to carbon nanotubes, single- and multi-wall {BN} nanotubes are constant-band-gap materials, independent of their radius and helicity. In addition, we expect them to exhibit remarkable properties under n -type doping.},

	abstract = {We perform ab initio calculations that indicate that the relative stability of antiphase boundaries ({APBs}) with armchair and zigzag chiralities in monolayer boron nitride ({BN}) is strongly dependent on the chemical potentials of boron (B) and nitrogen (N) in the synthesis process. For a realistic interval of chemical potentials, ranging from gas-phase to solid-state sources, a stoichiometric armchair {APB} with tetragons and octagons in its core and no homopolar bonds (N–N or B–B) is found to be the most stable in the intrinsic region of the chemical-potential interval, while for N-rich (B-rich) environments a zigzag-oriented boundary with a core consisting of hexagons only, containing N–N (B–B) bonds is found to be the most stable. Zigzag boundaries with core structures consisting of pentagons and octagons, containing homopolar bonds, are also considered in both undoped and carbon-doped forms. We find that at the typical temperatures of {BN}–nanostructure synthesis several of these zigzag boundaries should coexist with the armchair one, under N-rich or B-rich conditions. This stability transition arises from a competition between homopolar-bond and elastic-energy costs in the core of the {APBs}, in contrast with the case of graphene, where the zigzag geometry with pentagons and octagons is the most stable. We also address the stability of N- and B-terminated edges of {BN} triangular islands and find a robust stability for N-terminated edges, across a wide range of chemical potential values, in agreement with the experimentally observed tendency of {BN} islands to display N-terminated zigzag edges. We predict that fine-tuning the chemical potentials with a B-rich source where B atoms are in a bonding environment of low stability may lead to the formation of B-terminated zigzag edges. The electronic structure of the two types of {APBs} in {BN} is shown to be particularly distinct, with the zigzag {APB} depicting defect-like deep electronic bands in the band gap, while the armchair {APB} shows bulk-like shallow electronic bands.},

Ajayan et al. on Cu foils because of their unusual electronic properties ( Ci, L. J.; et al. Nat. Mater. 2010, 9, 430 − 435 ). However, many fundamental issues are still not clear, including the in-plane atomic continuity as well as the edge type at the boundary of hybridized h-{BN} and graphene domains. To clarify these issues, we have successfully grown a perfect single-layer h-{BN}-graphene ({BNC}) patchwork on a selected Rh(111) substrate, via a two-step patching growth approach. With the ideal sample, we convinced that at the in-plane linking interface, graphene and h-{BN} can be linked perfectly at an atomic scale. More importantly, we found that zigzag linking edges were preferably formed, as demonstrated by atomic-scale scanning tunneling microscopy images, which was also theoretically verified using density functional theory calculations. We believe the experimental and theoretical works are of particular importance to obtain a fundamental understanding of the {BNC} hybrid and to establish a deliberate structural control targeting high-performance electronic and spintronic devices.},

The two layers are offset in such a way as to expose a minimum metal surface area. Hole formation is likely driven by the lattice mismatch of the film and the rhodium substrate.

The temperature- and exposure-dependent growth of graphene is investigated in detail by scanning tunneling microscopy. {TPG} is found to yield compact graphene islands bounded by C zigzag edges. The island size may be tuned from a few to a couple of tens of nanometers through Smoluchowski ripening. In the {CVD} growth, the carbon in ethene molecules arriving on the Ir surface is found to convert with probability near unity to graphene.

It is found that the asymmetry of nanoribbon edges causes a uniform curvature of the ribbons due to structural stress in the aromatic ring plane. Narrow graphene nanoribbons terminated with fluorine on one side demonstrate a considerable out-of-plane bend, suggesting that the nanoribbon is a fraction of a conical surface. It is shown that the intrinsic curvature of the narrow nanoribbons destroys the periodicity and results in a systematic cancellation of the dipole moment. The in- and out-of-plane curvature of thin arcs allows their closure in nanorings or cone fragments of giant diameter. Using the fragment molecular orbital method, we optimized the structure of a planar giant arc and a closed ring of h-{BN} with a diameter of 105 nm.},

	abstract = {The transmission coefficient D(V) and the tunnel current I(V) for a trapezoidal potential barrier is calculated as a function of applied voltage V. In earlier works the {WKB} approximation was used evaluating the transmission coefficient and therefore only the barrier between the classical turning points was considered. The {WKB} transmission coefficient of a trapezoidal potential barrier is a monotonically decreasing function of applied voltage. In the present paper the exact treatment of the whole barrier shows that the transmission coefficient D(V) can be a function with superposed periodic oscillations. These oscillations are caused by partial reflection and interference of electron waves in the part of the trapezoidal barrier, where the potential energy is less than the kinetic energy of the electron. Also the calculated tunnel current I(V) can have a noticeable superposed oscillation. For observing this oscillation in metal-insulator-metal films the conditions are large electron mean free path (probable some hundred {AE}) in the dielectric layer and specular reflection from the barrier boundaries.},

From the {ABH} images of these surfaces low-value valleys along steps are clearly visible, as expected from “Smoluchowki smoothing.” A simple simulation of the valley makes us to be able to determine that the smoothing-induced dipole moment for Au and Cu steps is 0.16±0.05 and 0.5±0.15D/step atom, respectively.},

Previous studies relate the energy shift between peaks of the lowest-order Gundlach oscillation observed on the thin film and the metal substrate to the difference in their work functions. By observing Gundlach oscillations on Ag/Au(111), Ag/Cu(111), and Co/Cu(111) systems, we demonstrate that the work function difference is not the energy shift of the lowest order but the ones of higher order where a constant energy shift exhibits. Higher order Gundlach oscillations can thus be applied to determine the work function of thin metal films precisely.},

	abstract = {The reaction of glutamate dehydrogenase and glutamate (gl) with {NAD}+ and {NADP}+ has been studied with stopped-flow techniques. The enzyme was in all experiments present in excess of the coenzyme. The results indicate that the ternary complex (E-{NAD}(P)H-kg) is present as an intermediate in the formation of the stable complex (E-{NAD}(P)H-gl). The identification of the complexes is based on their absorption spectra. The binding of the coenzyme to (E-gl) is the rate-limiting step in the formation of (E-{NAD}(P)H-kg) while the dissociation of alpha-ketoglutarate (kg) from this complex is the rate-limiting step in the formation of (E-{NAD}(P)H-gl). The Km for glutamate was 20-25 {mM} in the first reaction and 3 {mM} in the formation of the stable complex. The Km values were independent of the coenzyme. The reaction rates with {NAD}+ were approximately 50\% greater than those with {NADP}+. Furthermore, high glutamate concentration inhibited the formation of (E-{NADH}-kg) while no substrate inhibition was found with {NADP}+ as coenzyme. {ADP} enhanced while {GTP} reduced the rate of (E-{NAD}(P)H-gl) formation. The rate of formation of (E-{NAD}(P)H-kg) was inhibited by {ADP}, while it increased at high glutamate concentration when small amounts of {GTP} were added. The results show that the higher activity found with {NAD}+ compared to {NADP}+ under steady-state assay conditions do not necessarily involve binding of {NAD}+ to the {ADP} activating site of the enzyme. Moreover, the substrate inhibition found at high glutamate concentration under steady-state assay condition is not due to the formation of (E-{NAD}(P)H-gl) as this complex is formed with Km of 3 {mM} glutamate, and the substrate inhibition is only significant at 20-30 times this concentration.},

Colored, particulate hide powder-azure, membrane fractions and soluble proteins such as hemoglobin, casein or albumin were susceptible to hydrolysis by the membraneous protease. Partial purification of the enzyme was accomplished through disc-gel electrophoresis on polyacrylamide in the presence of 0.25\% positively charged detergents like cetyltrimethylammonium bromide. An alkaline protease ({pH} 7.4) with properties similar to those of the erythrocyte enzyme was found in leucocytes. The similarity between the properties of the leucocytic and erythrocytic proteases and the correlation of the activity in erythrocyte membranes with content of white cells in these preparations, suggest that enzymatic activities in the contaminating leucocytes are responsible for the activity of membraneous proteases in erythrocytes.},

	abstract = {Effects of catecholamines and their inhibitors on the electrical activity of the smooth muscle of the guinea-pig stomach were studied by using pressure electrodes. The spontaneous electrical activity of antrum and corpus preparations consisted of slow waves with or without superimposed spikes. In quiescent fundus preparations, the spike activity and slow waves were generated by {TEA}. Catecholamines (noradrenaline, isoprenaline and adrenaline) suppressed or blocked the spike discharges and the generation of slow waves. However, the spike activity was enhanced at a higher concentration of phenylephrine in the antrumand fundus preparations. Inhibitory responses of the smooth muscles from whole regions to adrenaline, noradrenaline or isoprenaline were antagonized by propranolol or {DCI} but not by phentolamine or phenoxybenzamine. Therefore, inhibitory actions of these amines appear to involve beta-adrenoceptors. After treatment with tetrodotoxin, noradrenaline and isoprenaline blocked the spike activity and the generation of slow waves. Phenylephrine or adrenaline potentiated the spike activity in the presence of tetrodotoxin. After treatment with {DCI} or propranolol, phenylephrine potentiated the spike activity of the antrum and fundus preparations. These excitatory effects were antagonized by phentolamine or phenoxybenzamine. It is concluded that excitatory actions of these amines are mediated by alpha-adrenoceptors rather than via a nervous pathway.},

Using the enzymically nondegradable substrate analogues: {CnH}(2n+1)(0-){OOCH}2CH2N+({CH}3)3-(H,{OH}), it is shown that the rather hydrophobic N-terminal sequence of the enzyme, viz., Ala-Leu-Trp-Gln-Phe-Arg, is directly involved in the interaction with the lipid-water interface. Besides hydrophobic probably also polar interactions contribute to the binding process. At neutral or acidic {pH} the presence of a salt bridge between the N-terminal alpha-{NH}3+ group and a negatively charged side chain stablizes the interface recognition site and allows the enzyme to penetrate micellar surfaces, even in the absence of metal ion. At alkaline {pH}, interaction of the enzyme with micellar interfaces requires the presence of Ca2+ (Ba2+) ions.},

We investigate whether such reference varies for photoemitted electrons in nanometer-sized systems that expose different crystal planes. To this aim, we exploit the structural tunability of the Ag/Cu(223) system which is capable of offering surfaces with periodic arrays of nanofacets of varying size and orientation. A thorough, photon-energy-dependent analysis of the surface states confined to such nanostructures is performed comparing different reference planes for photoemitted electrons. Assuming the premise that k({\textbar}{\textbar}) must be a good quantum number for 2D states, we conclude that the (final state) photoelectron reference direction is not the average optical direction but the local facet that confines the (initial state) surface electrons. Moreover, in the general case of nanostructured systems with uneven surfaces, we show how the photoelectron reference plane can be empirically determined through such a photon-energy-dependent {ARPES} analysis.},

	shorttitle = {Beyond the surface atlas},
	abstract = {Throughout the development of single-crystal surface science, interest has predominantly focussed on the high-symmetry planes of crystalline materials, which typically present simple stable structures with small primitive unit cells. This concentration of effort has rapidly and substantially advanced our understanding of fundamental surface phenomena, and provides a sound basis for detailed study of more complex planes. The intense current interest in these is partly motivated by their regular arrays of steps, kinks or other low-coordination structural features, whose properties are little understood and may mimic specific highly-reactive sites on dispersed nanoparticles. Furthermore, the lower symmetry of these planes may give rise to other equally interesting properties such as intrinsic chirality, with exciting potential applications in enantioselective heterogeneous catalysis, biosensors and surface magnetism. To aid exploration of this new territory for surface science requires a depth of understanding that goes beyond the character of individual surfaces to encompass the global relationships between all possible surfaces of a given material, both in their structure and in their symmetry. In this report we present a rigorous conceptual framework for ideal crystalline surfaces within which the symmetry and structure of all possible surface orientations are described. We illustrate the versatility of our generally-applicable approach by comparing fcc, bcc and hcp materials. The entire scheme naturally derives from the very simple basis that the fundamental distinction between symmetry and structure is paramount. Where symmetry is concerned, our approach recognises that the surface is not a two-dimensional (21)) object but actually a truncated three-dimensional (3D) one. We therefore derive a symmetry scheme specifically formulated for surfaces and naturally encompassing their chirality where necessary. Our treatment of surface structure, on the other hand, highlights elementary one-dimensional ({ID}) features lying parallel to the surface plane. Crucial to the utility of these concepts is that both structure and symmetry can conveniently be represented independently within a single stereographic projection; this then serves as a "roadmap" that fully embodies the essential relationships between different surfaces and facilitates navigation amongst them. Key locations on the map identify surfaces of particular structural simplicity, which are collated in a gazetteer" with an accompanying description of their essential symmetry and structural character. Our symmetry-structure surface stereography (4S) analysis of fcc, bcc and hcp crystals reveals various new insights about the types of surface that they present. For instance, although the asymmetry of chiral fcc planes has hitherto been associated with the presence of kink sites, we show that the same is not always true of either bcc or hcp chiral surfaces. Kink-free chiral bcc planes offer particular advantages as model systems for asymmetric applications. We further reveal that the hcp crystal structure gives rise to intriguing types of surface that are not observed for either ficc or bcc materials. These include surfaces with intrinsic glide symmetry, surfaces with intrinsic racemic character and others displaying intrinsic double-chirality, analogous to the existence of diastereoisomers in molecular chemistry. We also identify several elementary surface structural categories that are specific to the hcp case. Having thus established a secure framework via ideal bulk-terminated crystalline surfaces, we subsequently demonstrate its extension to real surfaces. In considering how these differ from ideal surfaces we discuss relaxation and reconstruction within the same symmetry-resolved and structure-resolved perspective, drawing on numerous examples from the literature. Finally we illustrate the application of our scheme in one selected branch of surface science by exploring the symmetry-constraints on the surface chemistry of chiral molecules at chiral substrates.

On the mesoscopic scale, a rippled structure is formed in which Ag and Cu nanostripes alternate. A unique property of this hill-and-valley structure is that the periodicity of the stripes can be controlled via the Ag coverage.

The requirements for the growth of low-dimensional adsorbate structures at step edges of the vicinal (997) and (779) surfaces of platinum will be discussed in detail. Here energetics determined by the different adsorption sites and the kinetics present through the diffusion processes play an essential role. In order to obtain stable arrangements the propensity of the elements for alloy formation must be taken into account. Examples for the properties of the structures obtained and their role in studying one-dimensional systems are discussed, and we give a short outlook on how the principles of step decoration might be extended to a kind of atomic assembly of more complex surface nanostructures.},

Our {LEED} analysis of {NaCl}/Ag(100) shows that the average orientation of the {NaCl} unit mesh is the same as that of the Ag substrate, but rotational mosaics are formed in the (100) plane. The angular distribution of rotational angles has a width of +/-9degrees around the average direction. From this result we conclude that the direction of the substrate step edges determines the orientation of the {NaCl} islands. The steps of the vicinal silver surface are overgrown by elastic {NaCl} carpets. With increasing coverage, the modulation of the {NaCl} films by the step structure gets more and more washed out until, at around 10 {ML}, the whole film is only tilted by the nominal miscut of the sample. Closed films are only found at a thickness larger than 4 {ML}, as concluded from {EELS}.},

The lateral stripe spacing can be varied from ∼30 Å at 300 K to ∼230 Å at 600 K via the growth/annealing temperature. The present restructuring process is governed by the interplay between energetics and kinetics, namely by (1) the tendency to form (1 0 0)-terminated {NaCl} layers, (2) energetically favored interfacial matching between {NaCl}(1 0 0) and Cu(3 1 1), and (3) sufficient mobility of the substrate surface to allow for Cu mass transport.},

We study graphene on Ir, with Pb monolayer islands intercalated between the graphene sheet and the Ir surface. Although the graphene layer is structurally unaffected by the presence of the Pb islands, its electronic properties change markedly, with regularly spaced resonances appearing. We interpret these resonances as the effect of a strong and spatially modulated spin–orbit coupling, induced in graphene by the Pb monolayer. As well as confined electronic states, the electronic spectrum has a series of gaps with non-trivial topological properties, resembling a realization of the quantum spin Hall effect proposed by Bernevig and Zhang.},

	abstract = {Using a combination of complementary in situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction, we study the fundamental mechanisms underlying the chemical vapor deposition ({CVD}) of hexagonal boron nitride (h-{BN}) on polycrystalline Cu. The nucleation and growth of h-{BN} layers is found to occur isothermally, i.e., at constant elevated temperature, on the Cu surface during exposure to borazine. A Cu lattice expansion during borazine exposure and B precipitation from Cu upon cooling highlight that B is incorporated into the Cu bulk, i.e., that growth is not just surface-mediated. On this basis we suggest that B is taken up in the Cu catalyst while N is not (by relative amounts), indicating element-specific feeding mechanisms including the bulk of the catalyst. We further show that oxygen intercalation readily occurs under as-grown h-{BN} during ambient air exposure, as is common in further processing, and that this negatively affects the stability of h-{BN} on the catalyst. For extended air exposure Cu oxidation is observed, and upon re-heating in vacuum an oxygen-mediated disintegration of the h-{BN} film via volatile boron oxides occurs. Importantly, this disintegration is catalyst mediated, i.e., occurs at the catalyst/h-{BN} interface and depends on the level of oxygen fed to this interface. In turn, however, deliberate feeding of oxygen during h-{BN} deposition can positively affect control over film morphology. We discuss the implications of these observations in the context of corrosion protection and relate them to challenges in process integration and heterostructure {CVD}.},

The different pictures in orbital interactions between the pyrene core and the D–A substituents led to the outcome that 1,6-substituted pyrene derivative 1 had stronger electron-donating and electron-accepting properties in conjunction with a small {HOMO}–{LUMO} gap, as compared to the 2,7-substituted derivative. For these pyrene derivatives, modest (ΦF = 0.2) to strong (ΦF = 1.0) fluorescence was detected in degassed organic solvents; 1 exhibited a typical intramolecular charge transfer ({ICT}) emission obeying energy-gap law, while 2 displayed a moderate inverse energy-gap law, originating from the different substitution patterns. Although theoretical calculations predicted that both 1 and 2 adopt highly twisted {ICT} excited states ({TICT} excited states) even in the gas phase, but practically, it was suggested that the observed photophysical properties could be determined by the extent of twist angle of the {TICT}-like excited state in accordance with the solvent polarity. Moreover, the bulky D–A substituents inhibit the intermolecular direct π–π interactions, thereby resulting in the bright and moderate solid-state emissions for 1 (ΦF = 0.76) and 2 (ΦF = 0.21), respectively.},

	abstract = {Pyrene derivatives substituted at the 2- and 2,7-positions are shown to display a set of photophysical properties different from those of derivatives substituted at the 1-position. It was found that, in the 2- and 2,7-derivatives, there was little influence on the S2 ← S0 excitation, which is described as “pyrene-like”, and a strong influence on the S1 ← S0 excitation, which is described as “substituent-influenced”. In contrast, the 1-substituted derivatives display a strong influence on both the S1 ← S0 and the S2 ← S0 excitations. These observations are rationalized by considering the nature of the orbitals involved in the transitions. The existence of a nodal plane passing through the 2- and 7-positions, perpendicular to the molecular plane in the {HOMO} and {LUMO} of pyrene, largely accounts for the different behavior of derivatives substituted at the 2- and 2,7-positions. Herein, we report the photophysical properties of a series of 2-R-pyrenes \{R = C3H6CO2H (1), Bpin (2; pin = {OCMe}2CMe2O), {OC}3H6CO2H (3), O({CH}2)12Br (4), C≡{CPh} (5), C6H4-4-{CO}2Me (6), C6H4-4-B(Mes)2 (7), B(Mes)2 (8)\} and 2,7-R2-pyrenes \{R = Bpin (9), {OH} (10), C≡C({TMS}) (11), C≡{CPh} (12), C≡C-C6H4-4-B(Mes)2 (13), C≡C-C6H4-4-{NMe}2 (14), C6H4-4-{CO}2C8H17 (15), N(Ph)-C6H4-4-{OMe} (16)\} whose syntheses are reported elsewhere. Furthermore, we compare their properties to those of several related 1-R-pyrene derivatives \{R = C3H6CO2H (17), Bpin (18), C≡{CPh} (19), C6H4-4-B(Mes)2 (20), B(Mes)2 (21)\}. For all derivatives, modest (0.19) to high (0.93) fluorescence quantum yields were observed. For the 2- and 2,7-derivatives, fluorescence lifetimes exceeding 16 ns were measured, with most being ca. 50–80 ns. The 4-(pyren-2-yl)butyric acid derivative (1) has a long fluorescence lifetime of 622 ns, significantly longer than that of the commercially available 4-(pyren-1-yl)butyric acid (17). In addition to measurements of absorption and emission spectra and fluorescence quantum yields and lifetimes, time-dependent density functional theory calculations using the B3LYP and {CAM}-B3LYP functionals were also performed. A comparison of experimental and theoretically calculated wavelengths shows that both functionals were able to reproduce the trend in wavelengths observed experimentally.},

The disubstituted pyrene derivative 1 is not mesomorphic but produces robust and highly fluorescent gels in {DMF}, toluene, and cyclohexane. The well-defined fibers and ropes of the gel states were characterized by {SEM} and laser scanning confocal microscopy, and extended over several micrometers. The gels were integrated as active layers in field-effect transistors, which provided good bulk electron and hole charge mobilities as well as light emission generation. The tetra-substituted pyrene derivative is not a gelator but displays a stable liquid crystalline phase with 2D hexagonal symmetry between 20 and 200 °C. The pronounced luminescence properties of the mesophase allow one to observe original mesophase textures with flower-like patterns directly by fluorescence microscopy without crossed-polarizers.},

	abstract = {The concept of chirality dates back to 1848, when Pasteur manually separated left-handed from right-handed sodium ammonium tartrate crystals. Crystallization is still an important means for separating chiral molecules into their two different mirror-image isomers (enantiomers), yet remains poorly understood. For example, there are no firm rules to predict whether a particular pair of chiral partners will follow the behaviour of the vast majority of chiral molecules and crystallize together as racemic crystals, or as separate enantiomers. A somewhat simpler and more tractable version of this phenomenon is crystallization in two dimensions, such as the formation of surface structures by adsorbed molecules. The relatively simple spatial molecular arrangement of these systems makes it easier to study the effects of specific chiral interactions; moreover, chiral assembly and recognition processes can be observed directly and with molecular resolution using scanning tunnelling microscopy. The enantioseparation of chiral molecules in two dimensions is expected to occur more readily because planar confinement excludes some bulk crystal symmetry elements and enhances chiral interactions; however, many surface structures have been found to be racemic. Here we show that the chiral hydrocarbon heptahelicene on a Cu(111) surface does not undergo two-dimensional spontaneous resolution into enantiomers, but still shows enantiomorphism on a mesoscopic length scale that is readily amplified. That is, we observe formation of racemic heptahelicene domains with non-superimposable mirror-like lattice structures, with a small excess of one of the heptahelicene enantiomers suppressing the formation of one domain type. Similar to the induction of homochirality in achiral enantiomorphous monolayers by a chiral modifier, a small enantiomeric excess suffices to ensure that the entire molecular monolayer consists of domains having only one of two possible, non-superimposable, mirror-like lattice structures.},

The well-defined fibers and ropes of the gel states were characterized by {SEM} and laser scanning confocal microscopy, and extended over several micrometers. The gels were integrated as active layers in field-effect transistors, which provided good bulk electron and hole charge mobilities as well as light emission generation. The tetra-substituted pyrene derivative is not a gelator but displays a stable liquid crystalline phase with 2D hexagonal symmetry between 20 and 200 °C.

While chemical vapour deposition on catalytic metals has become a well developed approach for the growth of graphene and hexagonal boron nitride ({BN}), very few alternative approaches for synthesis on non-reactive supports have been explored so far. Here we report the growth of {BN} on gold, using magnetron sputtering of B in N 2 /Ar atmosphere, a scalable method using only non-toxic reagents. Scanning tunnelling microscopy at low coverage shows primarily triangular monolayer {BN} islands exhibiting two ‘magic’ orientations on the Au(111) surface. Such rotational alignment of {BN} on Au(111) is surprising, given the expected weak binding and the high lattice mismatch (∼14\%) between {BN} and Au. Our observations are consistent with a strong coupling between the edges of {BN} flakes and the substrate, which leads to the selection of {BN} orientations that maximize the orbital overlap between edge atoms and Au surface atoms. Diverse flake morphologies resembling the shape of butterflies, six-apex stars and diamonds, implying alternating B- and N- terminated edges, are observed as well. Our results provide insight into the growth mechanisms of 2D materials on weakly interacting and chemically inert substrates, and provide the basis for integrating other 2D materials with atomically precise graphene nanostructures synthesized from molecular precursors on Au.},

Films grown at {PTOT} ≤ 2.0 Torr are uniform in thickness, highly crystalline, and consist solely of h-{BN}. At larger {PTOT}, with constant precursor flow, the growth rate increases, but the resulting h-{BN} is more amorphous, disordered, and sp3-bonded. We attribute these changes in h-{BN} grown at high pressure to incomplete thermolysis of the H3N–{BH}3 precursor from a passivated Cu catalyst. A similar increase in h-{BN} growth rate and amorphization is observed even at low {PTOT} if the H3N–{BH}3 partial pressure is initially greater than the background pressure {PTOT} at the beginning of growth. h-{BN} growth using the H3N–{BH}3 precursor reproducibly can give large-area, crystalline h-{BN} thin films, provided that the total pressure is under 2.0 Torr and the precursor flux is well-controlled.},

A structured fluorescence band between 300 nm and 350 nm is assigned to impurity-band transition and its complex lineshape is attributed to phonon replicas. An additional band at 340 nm, assigned to {VN} vacancies on surface, is observed under vacuum and quenched by adsorbed molecular oxygen. {UV}-irradiation of h-{BN} under vacuum results in a broad asymmetric fluorescence at {\textasciitilde}400 nm assigned to m-{VN} vacancies; further irradiation breaks more B-N bonds enriching the surface with elemental boron. However, no boron deposit appears under irradiation of samples in ambient atmosphere. This effect is explained by oxygen healing of radiation-induced surface defects.

	abstract = {Suitable templates to steer the formation of nanostructure arrays on surfaces are indispensable in nanoscience. Recently, atomically thin sp2-bonded layers such as graphene or boron nitride ({BN}) grown on metal supports have attracted considerable interest due to their potential geometric corrugation guiding the positioning of atoms, metallic clusters or molecules. Here, we demonstrate three specific functions of a geometrically smooth, but electronically corrugated, sp2/metal interface, namely, {BN}/Cu(111), qualifying it as a unique nanoscale template. As functional adsorbates we employed free-base porphine (2H–P), a prototype tetrapyrrole compound, and tetracyanoquinodimethane ({TCNQ}), a well-known electron acceptor. (i) The electronic moirons of the {BN}/Cu(111) interface trap both 2H–P and {TCNQ}, steering self-organized growth of arrays with extended molecular assemblies. (ii) We report an effective decoupling of the trapped molecules from the underlying metal support by the {BN}, which allows for a direct visualization of frontier orbitals by scanning tunneling microscopy ({STM}). (iii) The lateral molecular positioning in the superstructured surface determines the energetic level alignment; i.e., the energy of the frontier orbitals, and the electronic gap are tunable.},

	abstract = {Conspectusπ-Conjugation between heterocyclic donor (D) and acceptor (A) groups via a polymethine chain leads to dyes with dipole moments greater than 10 D. These dipole moments direct the self-assembly of the dyes into antiparallel dimer aggregates, even in dilute solution, with binding strengths that are far beyond those observed for other π-scaffolds whose self-assembly is driven primarily by dispersion forces. The combination of directionality and exceptional binding strength of dipolar interactions between D-π-A dyes indeed resembles the situation of the hydrogen bond. Thus, similar to the latter, dipolar interactions between merocyanine dyes, a unique class of D-π-A chromophores, can be utilized to construct sophisticated supramolecular architectures of predictable geometry, particularly in low polarity environments.For bis(merocyanine) dyes it has been demonstrated that the self-assembly pathway is encoded in the tether between the two constituent merocyanine chromophores. If the tether enables the antiparallel stacking of the two appended dyes, folding takes place, which may be followed by further self-assembly into extended H-aggregate π-stacks at higher concentrations in solvents of low polarity. For tethers that do not support folding, the formation of bimolecular complexes of four merocyanine units, cyclic oligomers, and supramolecular polymers has been observed. For the former case, that is, formation of a bimolecular stack of four merocyanine units from tweezer-type molecules, association constants {\textgreater}109 M–1 were measured in chloroform. On the other hand, because only one π-face is utilized in the formation of supramolecular polymers from bis(merocyanine) dyes, higher hierarchical structures typically originate in which the other π-face is surrounded by an antiparallel π-stacked neighbor molecule.Among the observed self-assembled structures, nanorods in particular have attracted considerable attention because their self-assembly into well-defined H-aggregates falls under kinetic control and is slowed tremendously with decreasing solvent polarity. Co-assembly of achiral and chiral merocyanine building blocks or two enantiomers of a chiral merocyanine in different ratios provided insight into “majority rules” and “sergeant-and-soldiers” effects as well as the autocatalytic fiber growth process.With regard to materials applications, it is important to note that the high propensity for dipolar aggregation was disadvantageous for many envisioned applications of these dyes in the area of nonlinear optics. However, this aggregation behavior proved to be advantageous for the recently demonstrated applications of D-π-A dyes, in particular, merocyanines as p-type organic semiconductors in organic electronics and photovoltaics. Thus, organic transistors with hole mobilities {\textgreater}0.5 cm2/(V s) and organic solar cells with power conversion efficiencies {\textgreater}6\% could be achieved with merocyanine-based organic semiconductor molecules.},

	abstract = {Kontrolle über die energetischen Prozesse an Grenzflächen ist einer der zentralen Schritte zur Effizienzsteigerung von Licht-emittierenden und -absorbierenden Bauelementen zur Energieerzeugung auf Basis der organischen Materialklasse. In diesem Kontext gliedert sich die vorliegende Arbeit in das Gebiet der organischen Elektronik ein mit besonderem Fokus auf die Elektrode/Halbleiter Grenzfläche. Effiziente Injektion und Extraktion von Elektronen ist heutzutage immer noch ein kritischer Mechanismus, welcher optimiert werden muss. Der Transport von Elektronen durch diese Grenzfläche wird durch die energetische Injektionsbarriere Delta\_e dominiert. Um die Kontrolle über diese Barriere zu gewinnen, wurden polare Moleküle in dieser Arbeit verwendet, die eine gezielte Anpassung der Austrittsarbeit der Elektrode erlauben. Dabei wurden drei zentrale Themen behandelt: (i) Verständnis der chemischen und elektronischen Grenzfläche von N,N-dialkyl Dithiocarbamaten ({CnDTC}) auf den Edelmetallen Au, Ag und Cu. (ii) Einstellung der Austrittsarbeit mittels maßgeschneiderten Dithiocarbamaten. (iii) Vorstellung von ersten Ergebnissen zur Generation von niedrigen Austrittsarbeiten von transparentem, leitfähigem Indium Zinn Oxid ({ITO}) auf Basis einer modifizierten chemischen Struktur des {DTC}. Um diese Systeme zu studieren, wurde eine Kombination von Photoelektronenspektroskopie ({XPS}/{UPS}) mit Simulationsrechnungen basierend auf Dichtefunktionaltheorie ({DFT}) verwendet. Ladungstransport in elektronischen Bauelementen wurde anhand organischer Dünnschichttransistoren untersucht, welche mit dem n-typ Material {PTCDI}-C13betrieben wurden. (i) Vor Anfertigung dieser Arbeit wurde von unserer Forschungsgruppe berichtet, dass die Klasse der Dithiocarbamate ({DTC}) sehr niedrige Austrittsarbeiten von Gold bis zu 3.2 {eV} produzieren. Diese Ergebnisse markieren den Startpunkt für diese Arbeit. Die Bindung von N,N-dialkyl Dithiocarbamaten auf den drei Edelmetallen Au, Ag und Cu wurde mittels {XPS} untersucht. Dabei wurden dicht gepackte Monolagen auf Au und Ag identifiziert, während eine ungeordnete Lage auf Cu beobachtet wird. Trotzdem wird eine identische Austrittsarbeit von 3.5 {eV} für {CnDTC} mit n \&gt;= 4 auf allen Metallen mit {UPS} beobachtet. Nur Moleküle mit den kürzesten Alkylketten, d.h. n = \{1,2\}, ermöglichen Werte von 3.2 {eV} auf Au und Ag. Die finale Austrittsarbeit der modifizierten Metalle resultiert von einem komplexen Zusammenspiel von molekularer Anordnung (Bedeckungsdichte, Orientierung), Grenzflächendipol und Angleichung der  Energielevel an der Grenzfläche. Ein detaillierter Vergleich des C2DTC als Modellsystem auf den drei Metallen ermöglicht einen tieferen Einblick in die chemische und elektronische Struktur. Basierend auf experimentellen und theoretischen Ergebnissen kann eine gleiche Hybridisierung des molekularen S 3p Orbitals mit denen der energetisch höchstbesetzten, metallischen d-Bänder identifiziert werden. Dies resultiert in einem Metall/Molekül Grenzflächenzustand, welcher unabhängig von der ursprünglichen Austrittsarbeit des Metalls ist.(ii) Ein neuer Satz von Dithiocarbamaten wird vorgestellt und der Effekt von verschiedenen, polaren Endgruppen diskutiert. Die molekulare Struktur von Dithiocarbamaten wurde unter anderem mit aromatischen und fluorierten Substitutionen modifiziert, um unterschiedlich polare Momente des Moleküls zu erzeugen. Diese haben direkten Einfluss auf die resultierende Austrittsarbeit der modifizierten Elektrode und ermöglichen ein breites Fenster von verfügbaren Austrittsarbeiten für Edelmetalle auf Basis modifizierter Dithiocarbamate.(iii) Zuletzt wird der Schritt zur Modifikation von transparenten, leitfähigen Oxiden auf Basis der molekularen Struktur der Dithiocarbamate vollzogen. Dabei wird das häufig verwendete Indium Zinn Oxid ({ITO}) als Substrat genutzt. Zur Modifikation von Oxiden ist eine alternative, molekulare Bindungsgruppe nötig, um eine chemische Reaktion mit der Oberfläche einzugehen. Deshalb wurden hier Amino-substituierte Carboxylsäuren zur Modifikation verwendet. Damit konnte eine Reduzierung auf Werte bis zu 4.0 {eV} demonstriert werden. Diese ersten Resultate dienen als Wegweiser zur Identifikation neuer Moleküle, um noch geringere Austrittsarbeiten im Bereich derer von Dithiocarbamaten auf Edelmetallen zu generieren.

Control of the energetics at interfaces is one of the key steps that improve the efficiency of light-emitting and energy-conversion devices based on organic materials. In this context, the present work is embedded in the field of organic electronics with a special focus on the electrode/semiconductor interface. Efficient electron injection and extraction is still a crucial mechanism that deserves improvement. Electron transport through this interface is dominated by the energetic injection barrier Delta\_e. In order to gain control of this barrier, polar molecules have been used in this thesis to tailor the work function of the electrode. Three topics are addressed: (i) Understanding the chemical and electrical interface of N,N-dialkyl dithiocarbamates ({CnDTC}) on the noble metals Au, Ag and Cu. (ii) Work function tuning using tailor-made dithiocarbamates. (iii) Introduction of first results to generate low work functions of the transparent conductive indium tin oxide ({ITO}) based on a modified chemical structure of {DTCs}. To study these systems, a combination of X-ray and ultra-violet photoemission spectroscopy ({XPS}/{UPS}) with additional results from density functional theory ({DFT}) has been employed. Charge transport in electronic devices has been investigated using organic thin film transistors based on the n-type material {PTCDI}-C13.(i) Prior to this thesis, the class of dithiocarbamates ({DTC}) have been reported by our research group to produce very low work functions of gold down to 3.2 {eV}. This result marks the starting point for the present work. The assembly of N,N-dialkyl dithiocarbamates on the three noble metals Au, Ag and Cu has been analyzed with {XPS}. Therein, densely packed monolayers are identified on Au and Ag, while a disordered layer is observed on Cu. Nonetheless, a common work function of 3.5 {eV} is revealed for {CnDTC} with n \&gt;= 4 on all metals with {UPS}. Only those molecules with the shortest alkyl chains, i.e. n = \{1,2\}, were able to achieve 3.2 {eV} on Au and Ag. The final work function of the modified metals results from a complex interplay of molecular arrangement (surface coverage, orientation), interface dipole formation and the energy level alignment at the interface. The detailed comparison of C2DTC as a model system on the three noble metals generates a deeper insight into the chemical and electronic structure. Based on experimental and theoretical results, a common hybridization of the frontier S 3p orbital with those of the frontier metal d-states is identified to generate a metal/molecule interface state, that remains irrespective of the initial metal work function.(ii) A new set of dithiocarbamates are introduced and the effect of different polar groups attached to the molecular backbone is discussed. The molecular structure of dithiocarbamates has been modified using, among others, aromatic and fluorinated substitutions to induce different dipole moments. These directly affect the resulting work function of a modified electrode and enables the generation of a broad range of available work function values for noble metals using differently substituted dithiocarbamates.(iii) At last, the step towards modification of transparent conductive oxides based on the molecular structure of dithiocarbamates is explored for the commonly used indium tin oxide ({ITO}) as substrate. For metal oxides, a different linker group is required to bind to this kind of surface. Therefore, amine based carboxylic acids have been investigated as first candidates to lower the work function of {ITO}. A reduction down to 4.0 {eV} is demonstrated. This result may serve as guideline to create new surface modifiers that should generate even lower work functions similar to those of dithiocarbamates on noble metals.},

	abstract = {Molecular self-assembly is a well-known technique to create highly functional nanostructures on surfaces. Self-assembly on two-dimensional materials is a developing field and has already resulted in the discovery of several rich and interesting phenomena. Here, we review this progress with an emphasis on the electronic properties of the adsorbates and the substrate in well-defined systems, as unveiled by scanning tunneling microscopy ({STM}). We cover three aspects of the self-assembly. The first one focuses on non-covalent self-assembly dealing with site-selectivity due to inherent moire pattern present on 2D materials deposited on substrates. Modification of intermolecular interactions and molecule-substrate interactions influences the assembly drastically and 2D materials can also be used as a platform to carry out covalent and metal-coordinated assembly. The second part deals with the electronic properties of molecules adsorbed on 2D materials. By virtue of being inert and possessing low density of states near the Fermi level, 2D materials decouple molecules electronically from the underlying metal substrate and allow high-resolution spectroscopy and imaging of molecular orbitals. The moire pattern on the 2D materials causes site-selective gating and charging of molecules in some cases. The last section covers the effects of self-assembled organic molecules on the electronic properties of graphene as revealed by spectroscopy and electrical transport measurements. Non-covalent functionalization of 2D materials has already been applied for their application as catalysts and sensors. With the current surge of activity on building van der Waals heterostructures from 2D materials, molecular self-assembly has the potential to add an extra level of flexibility and functionality for applications ranging from flexible electronics and {OLEDs} to novel electronic devices and spintronics.},

	abstract = {Metal–organic coordination structures are materials comprising reticular metal centers and organic linkers in which the two constituents bind with each other via metal–ligand coordination interaction. The underlying chemistry is more than a century old but has attracted tremendous attention in the last two decades owing to the rapidly development of metal–organic (or porous coordination) frameworks. These metal-coordination materials exhibit extraordinarily versatile topologies and many potential applications. Since 2002, this traditionally three-dimensional chemistry has been extended to two-dimensional space, that is, to synthesize metal–organic coordination structures directly on solid surfaces. This endeavor has made possible a wide range of so-called surface-confined metal–organic networks ({SMONs}) whose topology, composition, property and function can be tailored by applying the principle of rational design. The coordination chemistry manifests unique characteristics at the surfaces, and in turn the surfaces provide additional control for design structures and properties that are inaccessible in three-dimensional space.
In this review, our goal is to comprehensively cover the progress made in the last 15 years in this rapidly developing field. The review summarizes (1) the experimental and theoretical techniques used in this field including scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy, low-energy electron diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, density functional theory, and Monte Carlo and kinetic Monte Carlo simulation; (2) molecular ligands, metal atoms, substrates, and coordination motifs utilized for synthesizing {SMON}; (3) representative {SMON} structures with different topologies ranging from finite-size discrete clusters to one-dimensional chains, two-dimensional periodical frameworks and random networks; and (4) the properties and potential applications of {SMONs}. We conclude the review with some perspectives.},

Here, we demonstrate that a high degree of structural control can be achieved by employing a Cu(110)-(2×1)O nanotemplate for the confined synthesis of organometallic chains and macrocycles. This template contains ordered arrays of alternating stripes of Cu–O chains and bare Cu, the widths of which are controllable. Using scanning tunneling microscopy and low-energy electron diffraction, we show that well-defined, ordered 1D zigzag organometallic oligomeric chains with uniform lengths can be fabricated on the Cu stripes (width {\textgreater}5.6 nm) of the Cu(110)-(2×1)O surface. In addition, the lengths of the meta-terphenyl ({MTP})-based chains can be adjusted by controlling the widths of the Cu stripes within a certain range. When reducing the widths of Cu stripes to a range of 2.6 to 5.6 nm, organometallic macrocycles including tetramer ({MTP}-Cu)4, hexamer ({MTP}-Cu)6, and octamer ({MTP}-Cu)8 species are formed due to the spatial confinement effect and attraction to the Cu–O chains. An overview of all formed organometallic macrocycles on the Cu stripes with different widths reveals that the origin of the formation of these macrocycles is the cis-configured organometallic dimer ({MTP})2Cu3, which was observed on the extremely narrow Cu stripe with a width of 1.5 nm.},

Under suitable conditions, the 1,3,5-benzenetribenzoic acid ({BTB}) self-assembles into an extended honeycomb mesh on graphene on Ir(111), with the molecules in the network being stabilized by linear hydrogen bonds between the carboxylic groups. The nanopores of the mesh are used to host and govern the assembly of cobalt phthalocyanine ({CoPC}) guest molecules. We characterize the assembled structures structurally and electronically using low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy ({STM}) and density functional theory ({DFT}) calculations. At a coverage higher than one {CoPc} per pore, the flexible hydrogen bonds of the host network undergo stretching to accommodate two {CoPCs} in a single pore. When the pores are uniformly doubly occupied, the guest molecules arrange into a herringbone pattern. This minimizes the energy cost associated with the stretching and twisting of the hydrogen bonds between the {BTB} molecules. The phenomenon observed here can be used to tailor molecular assemblies on graphene to controllably modify its properties. In addition, it allows the formation of guest monomers and dimers stabilized mechanically on the surface of graphene, an archetypical weakly interacting substrate.},

	title = {Modeling and simulation of organic molecular clusters and overlayers on solid surfaces},
	url = {http://drum.lib.umd.edu/handle/1903/11482},
	abstract = {Driven by the rapid development of experimental methods and technology, nano scale physics and chemistry has become more and more important and practicable to study. Monolayers of organic molecules have been studied a lot recently because of many potential applications, such as organic photovoltaic devices ({OPV}) or organic Liquid Electric Diodes ({OLED}). It is important to understand and interpret these new experimental advances. At molecular scales, Monte Carlo ({MC}) simulations and molecular dynamics ({MD}) are two important methods in computational chemistry and materials science. This dissertation will use these simulation methods along with statistical mechanical theory to study the behavior of single monolayers of organic molecules on solid surfaces.

	First we give a brief introduction to two dimensional molecular systems. Different from bulk system or single molecules, 2D systems have many unique properties, and attract much experimental and theoretical research attention. Some common methods in experimental and theoretical studies are reviewed.

	After introducing the properties and experimental results of {ACA}/Ag(111), we build a lattice gas model and run Monte Carlo simulations to help interpret the experiments.

	The Pair approximation, a generalization of mean-field theory, is used to calculate the global phase diagrams and put our model into the more general class of spin-1 Ising models. The pair approximation can be used for modeling various monolayer organic molecular systems which correspond to different regions of the parameter space.

Then we studied the C60/{ZnPc}/Ag(111) system, using molecular dynamic simulations. The C60 molecules form unusual chain structures instead of the close packed islands seen on metal surfaces, and we try to provide a theoretical explanation.

	Finally we use a density functional theory software to calculate the electronic structures of the C60/{ZnPc}/Ag(111) systems. This calculation predicts a 0.4e charge transfer from substrate to C60 molecule, which we believe is important for the C60 interactions on these surfaces.

	In general this thesis studies the behavior of organic monolayers and bilayers on metal substrates. This basic work could help us to understand general 2-D system dynamics and electronic properties, and may help us to find new interesting systems with special properties and applications.},

An extended assessment of our approach for the characterization of the geometrical and electronic structure of such systems is performed. Due to the lattice mismatch with the substrate, the monolayers can form Moiré-type superstructures with very long periodicities on the surface. Thus, proper models of these interfaces require very large simulation cells (more than 1,000 atoms) and an accurate description of interactions that are modulated with the specific registry of h-{BN} on the metal. We demonstrate that efficient and accurate calculations can be performed in such large systems using Gaussian basis sets and dispersion corrections to the (semi-)local density functionals. Four different metallic substrates, Rh(111), Ru(0001), Cu(111), and Ni(111), are explicitly considered, and the results are compared with previous experimental and computational studies.},

	abstract = {This Chapter deals with single layers of carbon (graphene) and hexagonal boron nitride on transition metal surfaces. The transition metal substrates take the role of the support and allow due to their catalytic activity the growth of perfect layers by means of chemical vapor deposition. The layers are sp2 hybridized honeycomb networks with strong in plane sigma and weaker pi bonds to the substrate and to the adsorbates. This hierarchy in bond strength causes anisotropic elastic properties, where the sp2 layers are stiff in plane and soft out of plane. A corrugation of these layers imposes a third hierarchy level in bond energies, with lateral bonding to molecular objects with sizes between 1 and 5 nanometer. This extra bond energies are in the range of thermal energies {kT} at room temperature and are particularly interesting for nanotechnology. The concomitant template function will be discussed. The peculiar bond hierarchy also imposes intercalation as another property of sp2 layer systems. Last but not least sp2 layer systems are particularly robust, i.e. survive immersion into liquids, which is a promise for sp2 layers being useful outside ultra high vacuum. The Chapter shortly recalls the synthesis, describes the atomic and electronic structure, is followed by a discussion of properties like intercalation and the use of sp2 layers on metals as tunneling junctions or as templates. The Chapter ends with an Appendix that summarizes the basics of atomic and electronic structure of honeycomb lattices. Of course the Chapter does not cover all aspects of sp2 single layers. Topics like free standing layers, edge structures of ribbons, topological defects, or mechanical and chemical properties were not covered.},

We have studied submonolayer coverage of manganese phthalocyanine ({MnPc}) on hexagonal boron nitride (h-{BN}) on Rh(111) as a model system by low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy ({STM}) and spectroscopy ({STS}). The adsorbed molecules show three distinctly different bias-dependent topographic signatures, which depend on their adsorption positions on the h-{BN}. Among these three types of {MnPc}, one shows pronounced charging because of the proximity of the highest occupied molecular orbital ({HOMO}) to the Fermi level on the decoupling h-{BN} substrate. The charging of the {MnPc} from its neutral to the {MnPc}+ state leads to a down shift of the Mn 3d-related orbital by 840 {meV} as determined from the difference in energy position between high- and low-bias charging. We find that the charging field is linearly related to the {HOMO} position with respect to the Fermi level, with a clear correlation to the adsorption orientations of the {MnPc}. Our results show how critically energy level alignment and field-induced charge transfer process can depend on adsorption configurations, even on an apparently low-interacting substrate like metal supported monolayer h-{BN}.},

In a boron nitride nanomesh formed on Rh(111), the pattern consisted of holes 2 nanometers in diameter on a hexagonal superlattice, separated by about 3 nanometers. The trapping was further investigated with density functional theory and the photoemission of adsorbed xenon, where the holes were identified as regions of low work function. The analysis showed that the trapping potential was localized at the rims of the holes.
Holes in a boron nitride surface ringed by in-plane dipoles form a nanometer-scale pore network with a trapping potential that can hold weakly adsorbed molecules.

Using scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy, we demonstrate the selective adsorption and the formation of ordered molecular arrays of iron phthalocyanine and pentacene molecules of different structural symmetries on the graphene/Ru(0001) templates. With in-depth investigations of the molecular adsorption and assembly processes, we reveal the existence of site-specific, lateral electric dipoles (or lateral electric fields) in the epitaxial graphene monolayers and the capability of the dipoles in directing and driving the molecular adsorption and assembly. We show that the lateral dipoles originate from the inhomogeneous distribution of charge due to the epitaxial constraint of graphene on a Ru(0001) surface. The adsorption mechanism is rather general and applicable to similar molecular systems on graphene monolayers formed on other transition metal surfaces.},

With regard to the gas-phase species, ab initio calculations showed that (1) the benzonitrile dimer has a single stable structure that is planar and antiparallel; (2) the trimer has two isoenergetic stable structures, that is, a planar and cyclic structure and an antiparallel and nonplanar one; (3) the clusters are more stable, at low temperatures, than the monomer. For the adsorbed species, we made quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical calculations in which the interaction between the adsorbates and the surface is evaluated in a molecular-mechanical way by using analytical potential functions and an image charge model. Because the stable structures were found to be similar to those in the gas phase, the cluster formation of adsorbed cyanophenyl porphyrins was attributed to the interaction between cyanophenyl groups, which is barely affected by adsorbate−surface interaction. It was also found that the adsorbed cyclic benzonitrile trimer is more stable than the monomer and the dimer because the relative stability is dependent on enthalpy alone. We therefore concluded that the preferential formation of trimers by the adsorbed cyanophenyl porphyrins is due to the negligible contribution of entropy to the relative stability of the adsorbed species and that the adsorption hardly changes the situation found in the gas phase.},

A distinct anisotropic interaction between the ring systems and the electron lone pairs of cyanide, water and other acceptor species is revealed that favors the in-plane orientation of the proton acceptor group. In the attractive regime this interaction carries a pronounced electrostatic signature. By decomposing the electrostatic contribution into parts attributed to different subunits of the ring systems we demonstrate that a major proportion of the interaction energy gain is originating from the non-adjacent moieties, that are not in close contact with. This behavior holds equally for homocyclic, heterocyclic and non-aromatic rings but contrasts that of the ethyne molecule, taken as reference for a weak hydrogen bond donor clearly exhibiting the expected localized character. The ring interaction requires the presence of π-electron clouds and typically results in an interaction energy gain of 40 to 80 {meV}. Our findings suggest the proton acceptor–ring interaction as a new category of intermolecular non-covalent interactions.},

Depending on the deposition conditions, {TAPP} forms three main assemblies, which result from initial submonolayer coverages based on different intermolecular interactions: a close-packed assembly similar to a projection of the bulk structure of {TAPP}, in which the molecules interact mainly through van der Waals ({vDW}) forces and weak hydrogen bonds; a porous copper surface coordination network; and covalently linked molecular chains. The Cu substrate is of crucial importance in determining the structures of the aggregates and available reaction channels on the surface, both in the formation of the porous network for which it provides the Cu atoms for surface metal coordination and in the covalent coupling of the {TAPP} molecules at elevated temperature. Apart from their role in the kinetics of surface transformations, the available metal adatoms may also profoundly influence the thermodynamics of transformations by coordination to the reaction product, as shown in this work for the case of the Cu-decorated covalent poly({TAPP}Cu) chains.},

The Cu adatoms coordinated in the porous surface network of 1,3,8,10-tetraazaperopyrene ({TAPP}) molecules on a Cu(111) surface give rise to a characteristic electronic resonance in {STM} experiments. Using density functional theory calculations, we provide strong evidence that this resonance is a fingerprint of the interaction between the molecules and the Cu adatoms. We also show that the bonding of the Cu adatoms to the organic exodentate ligands is characterised by both the mixing of the nitrogen lone-pair orbitals of {TAPP} with states on the Cu adatoms and the partial filling of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ({LUMO}) of the {TAPP} molecule. Furthermore, the key interactions determining the surface unit cell of the network are discussed.},

Deposition of Br4Py on Cu(111) held at 300 K resulted in a spontaneous debromination reaction, generating the formation of a branched coordination polymer network stabilized by C−Cu−C bonds. After annealing at 473 K, the C−Cu−C bonds were converted to covalent C−C bonds, leading to the formation of a covalently linked molecular network of short oligomers. In contrast, highly ordered self-assembled two-dimensional (2D) patterns stabilized by both Br−Br halogen and Br−H hydrogen bonds were observed upon deposition of Br4Py on Au(111) held at 300 K. Subsequent annealing of the sample at 473 K led to a dissociation of the C−Br bonds and the formation of disordered metal-coordinated molecular networks. Further annealing at 573 K resulted in the formation of covalently linked disordered networks. Importantly, we found that the chosen substrate not only plays an important role as catalyst for the Ullmann reaction, but also influences the formation of different types of intermolecular bonds and thus, determines the final polymer network morphology. {DFT} calculations further support our experimental findings obtained by {STM} and {XPS} and add complementary information on the reaction pathway of Br4Py on the different substrates.},

High resolution {STM} images revealed that {PT} tended to build a chevron pattern with individual peanut-shaped molecule; moreover, {PD} was apt to form a simple linear chain with single pearl-like molecule. Density functional theory ({DFT}) calculations employing the state-of-the art method of {PBE} + {vdWsurf} revealed that the hydrogen bonding from molecule–molecule interactions ({PT}–{PT}, {PD}–{PD}) and van der Waals ({vdW}) forces from building molecule–substrate ({PT}–graphite, {PD}–graphite) interactions played noticeable roles in the construction of these supramolecular architectures. By comparing the chemical structural differences between these two types of molecular building blocks, this study concisely and explicitly demonstrates that the advantages, such as structural symmetry and functional groups, possessed by building molecules promote the efficient synergy of multiple intermolecular non-covalent interactions and the feasible self-assembly of different supramolecular monolayers on diverse surfaces.},

Most applications require the deposition of thin molecular films onto conductive electrodes. The growth of the first few molecular layers represents a crucial step in the device fabrication since it determines the structure of the molecular film and the energy level alignment of the metal–organic interface. Here, we explore the formation of this interface by analyzing the interplay between reversible molecule–substrate charge transfer, yielding intermolecular repulsion, and van der Waals attractions in driving the molecular assembly. Using a series of ad hoc designed molecules to balance the two effects, we combine scanning tunnelling microscopy with atomistic simulations to study the self-assembly behavior. Our systematic analysis identifies a growth mode characterized by anomalous coarsening that we anticipate to occur in a wide class of metal–organic interfaces and which should thus be considered as integral part of the self-assembly process when depositing a molecule on a conducting surface.},

	abstract = {Discrete and multicomponent nanoscale noncovalent assemblies on surfaces featuring polygonal porous domains are presented. The molecular engineering concept involves multivalent molecular modules that are preprogrammed to undergo heteromolecular recognition by exploiting complementary multiple H bonds. Two types of molecular modules have been engineered: (i) a linear unit of twofold symmetry exposing two 2,6-di(acylamino)pyridyl [donor−acceptor−donor ({DAD})] recognition sites at its extremities with a 180° orientation relative to each other and (ii) an angular unit constituted by a 1,3,6,8-tetraethynylpyrene core peripherally functionalized with four uracil groups [acceptor−donor−acceptor ({ADA})] positioned at 60° and 120° relative to each other. These molecular modules self-assemble through H-bonds between the complementary recognition sites, forming supramolecular architectures. Their symmetry depends upon the type of each individual subunit and the stoichiometry as well as on the combination and distribution of the main symmetry axes. These so-formed two-dimensional (2D) supramolecular oligomers have been studied in solution by optical spectroscopy and on highly ordered pyrolitic graphite ({HOPG}) substrates by scanning tunneling microscopy ({STM}) at the solid−liquid interface. Steady-state {UV}/vis absorption and emission titration measurements suggest the reversible formation of multiple oligomeric species with slightly modulated fluorescence spectra. This likely reflects the presence of various aggregates between the two polytopic receptors, which exhibit somewhat different electronic delocalization as a function of the aggregate size. The presence of multiple species is further confirmed by time-resolved luminescence measurements: lifetime values are fitted as double/multiple exponentials and are always shorter than 6.5 ns. The formation of several oligomeric species is further supported by in situ {STM} measurements at the solid−liquid interface that provided evidence, with submolecular resolution, for the formation of multicomponent and discrete 2D polygon-like assemblies. We highlight the role of accurate control of the concentration required to image on the surface the 2D oligomeric species formed in solution, which allows us to bypass the determinant role of the substrate−molecule interactions in forming the thermodynamically stable monocomponent architectures at the solid−liquid interface.},

	abstract = {We investigated the structure and crystalline quality of monolayer graphene grown by hydrogen and methane chemical vapor deposition ({CVD}) on polycrystalline Cu foils. Our data show that the high temperature hydrogen pretreatment of the Cu foil has to be performed at a sufficiently high H2 pressure in order to avoid graphene (g) formation already during the pretreatment, which limits the achievable domain size during subsequent growth in the {CH}4/H2 mixture. Methane–hydrogen {CVD} sustains g growth but induces the faceting of the Cu substrate. Characterization by low energy electron microscopy evidenced a staircase Cu substrate morphology of alternating (4 1 0) and (1 0 0) planes interrupted by (n 1 1) type facets. The g flakes cover the staircase shaped support as a coherent layer. The polycrystalline film mostly contains rotational domains that are preferentially, but not strictly, aligned with respect to the stepped support surface. The substrate induced corrugated morphology occurs also underneath large single crystalline flakes and is transferred to suspended membranes, produced by etching the Cu underneath the graphene. Thus, membranes manufactured from g-Cu are non flat. This explains their reported softened elastic response and the formation of so called nanorippled graphene after transfer from the Cu support which deteriorates its electrical conductivity.},

Today, graphene is limited to small sizes because it is produced mostly by exfoliating graphite. We grew large-area graphene films of the order of centimeters on copper substrates by chemical vapor deposition using methane. The films are predominantly single-layer graphene, with a small percentage (less than 5\%) of the area having few layers, and are continuous across copper surface steps and grain boundaries. The low solubility of carbon in copper appears to help make this growth process self-limiting. We also developed graphene film transfer processes to arbitrary substrates, and dual-gated field-effect transistors fabricated on silicon/silicon dioxide substrates showed electron mobilities as high as 4050 square centimeters per volt per second at room temperature.
Predominantly single-layer graphene films grow in a self-limited manner on copper and can be transferred to other substrates.

Here we report the formation of ordered Cu(100) p(2×2) oxygen superstructures by oxygen intercalation under the monolayer hexagonal boron nitride (h-{BN}) on Cu after annealing. By using scanning tunneling microscopy and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, we identify the superstructure and reveal its roles in passivating the exposed Cu surfaces, decoupling h-{BN} and Cu, and disintegrating h-{BN} monolayers. The oxygen superstructure appears as a 2D pattern on the exposed Cu surface or quasi-1D stripes of paired oxygen intercalated in the interface of h-{BN} and Cu predominantly oriented along the moiré modulations. The oxygen superstructure is shown to etch the overlaying h-{BN} monolayer in a thermal annealing process. After extended annealing, the h-{BN} monolayer disintegrates into nanoislands with zigzag edges. We discuss the implications of these findings on the stability and oxidation resistance of h-{BN} and relate them to challenges in process integration and 2D heterostructures.},

The moiré superstructure leads to a periodic arrangement of strongly chemisorbed valleys in an otherwise rather flat, weakly physisorbed plane. The best commensurate approximation of the moiré unit cell is (12 × 12) boron nitride cells resting on (11 × 11) substrate cells, which is at variance with several earlier studies. We uncover the existence of two fundamentally different mechanisms of layer formation for hexagonal boron nitride, namely, nucleation and growth as opposed to network formation without nucleation. The different pathways are linked to different distributions of rotational domains, and the latter enables selection of a single orientation only.},

A distinct anisotropic interaction between the ring systems and the electron lone pairs of cyanide, water and other acceptor species is revealed that favors the in-plane orientation of the proton acceptor group. In the attractive regime this interaction carries a pronounced electrostatic signature. By decomposing the electrostatic contribution into parts attributed to different subunits of the ring systems we demonstrate that a major proportion of the interaction energy gain is originating from the non-adjacent moieties, that are not in close contact with. This behavior holds equally for homocyclic, heterocyclic and non-aromatic rings but contrasts that of the ethyne molecule, taken as reference for a weak hydrogen bond donor clearly exhibiting the expected localized character. The ring interaction requires the presence of π-electron clouds and typically results in an interaction energy gain of 40 to 80 {meV}. Our findings suggest the proton acceptor–ring interaction as a new category of intermolecular non-covalent interactions.},

As found earlier for racemic heptahelicene on Cu(111), the racemate forms zigzag rows with alternating enantiomers. In contrast to Cu(111), no enantiomorphism in the form of oblique alignment of molecular adlattice vectors with respect to substrate lattice vectors is observed. That is, the zigzag rows run parallel to the high-symmetry directions of the substrate. Because of the larger interatomic distances, stress builds up in the racemic molecular layer on Ag(111), which leads to relaxation into different structures after every third or fourth zigzag row.

	abstract = {{ConspectusThe} chiral recognition among biomolecules is fundamentally important for many processes of life, including the stereochemistry of evolution. Of special interest is chiral recognition during crystallization of racemates, when either homochiral recognition leads to a conglomerate of homochiral crystals or heterochiral recognition dominates resulting in a racemic compound. The complex nature of molecular recognition at the level of nucleation and crystal growth renders it difficult to understand and calls for manageable model systems. Notably, the approach of studying aggregation of molecules at surfaces under well-defined conditions includes the benefit of the availability of a multitude of highly sensitive investigation methods, of which scanning tunneling microscopy ({STM}) with its submolecular resolution is tremendously valuable. Heterogeneous nucleation at surfaces is strongly favored over homogeneous nucleation in solution; hence, surfaces are significantly involved in stereochemical recognition during crystallization.Helicenes are a fascinating class of chiral compounds with outstanding optical activity. These π-conjugated, ortho-fused, aromatic hydrocarbons are promising candidates for organic electronic devices such as sensors, circular dichroic photonics, liquid crystal displays or spin filters. But in particular the defined footprint of their terminal benzo rings on a surface makes them interesting for studying stereochemical recognition with different single crystalline surfaces and the impact this has, in turn, on intermolecular recognition.In this Account, we describe the self-assembly of helicenes on metal surfaces with the focus on stereochemical recognition in two-dimensional structures. Using the isomeric all-carbon helicenes, heptahelicene and dibenzohelicene as examples, different aggregation phenomena on different surfaces of single crystalline copper, silver, and gold are investigated. By means of {STM} different modes of transmission of molecular handedness from single molecules into extended two-dimensional supramolecular structures are identified. For the problem of racemate versus conglomerate crystallization, the impact of surface and molecular structure and their interplay are analyzed. This leads to detailed conclusions about the importance of the match of molecular and surface binding sites for long-range self-assembly. The absence of polar groups puts emphasis on van der Waals interaction and their maximization by steric overlap of molecular parts in enantiomeric and diastereomeric interactions. With {STM} as a manipulation tool, dimers are manually separated in order to analyze their chiral composition. And finally, new nonlinear cooperative effects induced by small enantiospecific bias are discovered that lead to single enantiomorphism in two-dimensional racemate crystals as well as in racemic multilayered films. By means of these model studies many details that govern chiral recognition at surfaces are rationalized.},

	abstract = {Chirality—or ‘handedness’—is a symmetry property crucial to fields as diverse as biology, chemistry and high-energy physics. In graphene, chiral symmetry emerges naturally as a consequence of the carbon honeycomb lattice. This symmetry can be broken by interactions that couple electrons with opposite momenta in graphene. Here we directly visualize the formation of Kekulé bond order, one such phase of broken chiral symmetry, in an ultraflat graphene sheet grown epitaxially on a copper substrate. We show that its origin lies in the interactions between individual vacancies in the copper substrate that are mediated electronically by the graphene. We show that this interaction causes the bonds in graphene to distort, creating a phase with broken chiral symmetry. The Kekulé ordering is robust at ambient temperature and atmospheric conditions, indicating that intercalated atoms may be harnessed to drive graphene and other two-dimensional materials towards electronically desirable and exotic collective phases.},

	abstract = {The question of racemate versus conglomerate stability is tremendously important for chiral resolution via crystallization methods. Scanning tunneling microscopic studies with molecular resolution on two-dimensional (2D) model systems contribute at large to solve problems on complex crystallization phenomena. The dependence of lattice polymorphism and enantiomorphism on coverage and enantiomeric excess has been investigated for monolayers of enantiopure and racemic heptahelicene on a Cu(111) surface in ultrahigh vacuum. The densest packing is achieved in a homochiral lattice structure. This should favor 2D conglomerate formation for the racemate, since a higher coverage leads to an overall lower energy. However, only heterochiral structures are observed. Small enantiomeric excess (ee) induces lattice homochirality by suppressing one enantiomorph. At larger ee, we observe crystals disordered at the molecular level. Long-range ordered homochiral structures are suppressed due to small chiral impurities. The preference of a 2D racemic compound formation, the induction of lattice homochirality at small ee, and the solid solution formation at larger ee are discussed in the light of energetic, entropic, and kinetics effects.},

Here, we introduce the synthesis of a family of pyrene derivatives peripherally functionalized with pyridin-4-ylethynyl termini and comprehensively characterize their self-assembly abilities on a smooth Ag(111) support by scanning tunneling microscopy. By deliberate selection of number and geometric positioning of the pyridyl-terminated substituents, two-dimensional arrays, one-dimensional coordination chains, and chiral, porous kagomé-type networks can be tailored. A comparison to phenyl-functionalized reference pyrenes, not supporting the self-assembly of ordered structures at low coverage, highlights the role of the pyridyl moieties for supramolecular crocheting and knitting. Furthermore, we demonstrate the selective spangling of pores in the two-dimensional pyrene assemblies by a distinct number of iodine atoms as guests by atomically resolved imaging and complementary X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy.},

	abstract = {Carbohelicenes are a class of fascinating chiral helical molecules which have a rich history in chemistry. Over a period of almost 100 years, chemists have developed many methods to prepare them in a racemic or in a non-racemic form. They also possess a series of interesting chiral, physical, electronic and optical properties. However, their utilization in chemistry or chemistry-related fields has rarely appeared in a detailed and comprehensive review. It is the purpose of this review to collect fundamental applications and functions involving carbohelicenes in various disciplines such as in materials science, in nanoscience, in biological chemistry and in supramolecular chemistry. From the numerous synthetic methodologies reported up to now, carbohelicenes and their derivatives can be tailor-made for a better involvement in several subfields. Among those domains are: nanosciences, chemosensing, liquid crystals, molecular switches, polymers, foldamers, supramolecular materials, molecular recognition, conductive and opto-electronic materials, nonlinear optics, chirality studies and asymmetric synthesis. Helicene chemistry is now at a developmental stage, where sufficient application data are now collected and are extremely useful. They provide many more ideas for setting up the basis for future innovative applications.},

The conformational adaptation of the molecular module gives rise to two enantiomers upon 2D confinement, which self-assemble in enantiopure clusters made of three molecules reflecting chiral recognition, which constitute the secondary supramolecular building block mediating the formation of the tertiary complex open networks. Our results show that the creation of homochiral superstructures based on the hierarchical assembly of conformationally flexible molecular components constitutes a unique pathway toward the design of novel and functional chiral structures.},

An analysis of scanning tunneling microscopy ({STM}) data reveals the occurrence of two enantiomers, resulting from the surface confinement that deconvolutes the module in 2D-chiral conformational isomers. The stereoisomers exhibit site-specific surface anchoring, from whence three discrete orientations are possible for each species. Their sequence and mutual arrangement determine direction and curvature of the metal?organic chains. The Cu-coordinated polymers are very similar on both Cu(111) and Ag(111), where their formation is induced by intrinsic and coevaporated adatoms, respectively, which indicates that the lateral bonding motif is predominantly independent of the substrate. In addition, molecular manipulation experiments show the collective motion of entire segments of the Cu-coordinated multi-porphyrin polymers.},

	abstract = {Volume changes of polyallylamine-derived hydrogels crosslinked with glutaraldehyde are determined with a large variety of effector compounds. Monocarboxylic effectors lead to smaller contractions, in contrast to dicarboxylate structures, which allow more effective non-covalent crosslinking between the positively charged nitrogen centers of the polymer backbone. Electroneutral compounds lead to negligible changes, whereas effectors with either a large p-moiety like in naphthoic acid or phenyl derivatives with polarizable substituents induce large contractions. This finding is in line with significant contributions of van der Waals interactions between the effectors within the hydrogel. Chemomechanical differences between regioisomeric effectors such as p- and o-nitrobenzoic acid are in agreement with independent results of dispersive interactions in related complexes. The volume decrease corresponds almost entirely to the gravimetrically determined water content of the gels. The acidity profile shows a strong contraction above {pH} 10, which is consistent with the known {pK} value of such polyamines. {NMR} spectra of the gels indicate strong binding of the effectors by line broadening, which is significant only for the chemomechanically active compounds.

In this paper we address a number of conceptual questions that are often encountered when teaching capillarity. By answering these questions we provide a perspective that reconciles the macroscopic viewpoints, from thermodynamics or fluid mechanics, and the microscopic perspective from statistical physics.},

This requires the meticulous fabrication of desired organic structures by precisely controlling the interactions between molecules. The well-known principles of organic coordination chemistry cannot be applied without proper consideration of extra molecular hybridization, charge transfer and dipole formation at the interfaces. Here we identify the interplay between energy level alignment, charge transfer, surface dipole and charge pillow effect and show how these effects collectively determine the net force between adsorbed porphyrin 2H-{TPP} on Cu(111). We show that the forces between supported porphyrins can be altered by controlling the amount of charge transferred across the interface accurately through the relative alignment of molecular electronic levels with respect to the Shockley surface state of the metal substrate, and hence govern the self-assembly of the molecules.},

Tailored substituents optimize their performance, dictating their arrangement in specific environments and mediating the assembly of molecular nanoarchitectures.

We have found that the Cu(110)–(2 × 1)–O surface is intrinsically unstable under thermal annealing in the 400–900 K range. In the 455–570 K range, the surface undergoes faceting. The orientational transition of the adsorbed oxygen phase displays wide [110] terraces, covered by (2 × 1)–O bands self-assembled into a superstructure, as well as bunches of oxygen-free narrow terraces. We found that the wide [110] terraces are intrinsically unstable against further restructuring at their edges. The restructuration is driven by reversible thermal dissociation of the (2 × 1)–O bands. The slightly uneven oxygen band density between terraces, consequently differing in reactivity with respect to Cu–O fragments, induces Cu atom transport between their edges. The interplay between thermal dissociation of the (2 × 1)–O bands and long-range elastic relaxation of the strained surface is suggested to be the origin of the observed inhomogeneous oxygen distribution. In the 570–810 K range the Cu atom transport reveals continuous growth of the oxygenated [110] terraces. We discuss in detail the mechanism of the Cu transport, which results in a rapid propagation of the oxygenated terraces as well as a strain development on the surface.},

	abstract = {From an interplay between variable temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and density–functional theory calculations, the evolution of oxygen chemisorption-induced surface reconstructions of the Cu(110) surface is determined. The surface reconstructions proceed via a sequential pathway with increasing oxygen surface coverage. The (2 × 1) reconstruction occurs first and then transits to the c(6 × 2) phase with a higher oxygen coverage through a mechanism that consumes the existing (2 × 1) phase with the supply of Cu adatoms from step edges and terraces. The temperature dependence of the (2 × 1) → c(6 × 2) transition demonstrates that the surface phase transition is an activated process for breaking up added Cu–O–Cu rows in the (2 × 1) structure. Comparison between the experimental observations and the theoretical surface phase diagram obtained from first-principles thermodynamic calculations reveals that the (2 × 1) → c(6 × 2) transition takes place at the oxygen chemical potentials that are far above the chemical potential for Cu2O bulk oxide formation, reflecting the existence of kinetic limitations to the surface phase transition and the bulk oxide formation.},

Thin films were prepared by organic molecular beam epitaxy and subsequent annealing. Our systematic study provides an understanding of the changes of the spectroscopic signature during adsorption and metalation. Specifically, we achieved a detailed peak assignment of the 2H-{TPP} multilayer data of the C1s and the N1s region. After annealing to 420 K both {XPS} and {NEXAFS} show the signatures of a metalloporphyrin, which indicates self-metalation at the porphyrin-substrate interface, resulting in Cu-{TPP}. Furthermore, for 2H-{TPP} monolayer samples we show how the strong influence of the copper surface is reflected in the spectroscopic signatures. Adsorption results in a strongly deformed macrocycle and a quenching of the first {NEXAFS} resonance in the nitrogen edge suggesting electron transfer into the {LUMO}. For Cu-{TPP} the spectroscopic data indicate a reduced interaction of first-layer molecules with the substrate as demonstrated by the relaxed macrocycle geometry.},

	abstract = {The adsorption of {CO} on Cu(111) has been re-investigated using Fourier transform reflection absorption infrared spectroscopy ({FT}-{RAIRS}), electron energy loss spectroscopy ({EELS}) and low energy electron diffraction ({LEED}). The combination of these techniques has revealed important new information about this system. At 95 K three adsorption stages (1 to 3) can be distinguished, leading to successive ordered overlayer structures (I to {III}). Stage 1 exists for coverages up to 0.33 and involves linearly bound species only. The sharpest band observed during the course of these experiments, with an intrinsic {FWHM} of 4.5 cm−1, is associated with a coverage of 0.33 and an ordered (√3 × √3)R30 ° structure (I). Stage 2 is associated with the coverage regime 0.33−0.44. In this stage {EELS} data show tilted, linear {CO} species are present. No bridged species exist at this point. On the basis of this, we propose a new overlayer structure ({II}), for θ = 0.44. Increasing the coverage gives stage 3. During this process, the high resolution {FT}-{RAIRS} spectra resolved two bands associated with linear {CO} species. The behaviour of these bands suggests that the final structure ({III}) is formed in a step-wise manner, with islands of ({II}) and ({III}) coexisting in the adlayer. Both linear and bridged species exist in stage 3. The bandshapes suggest significant inhomogeneities in the adlayer are present at the saturation coverage. Finally, the concentration of bridged species is found to be very sensitive to the adsorption temperature.},

The variation, including the sign (decrease or increase) of the work functions as a result of {CO} adsorption, is identified to be due to the reversal or change in magnitude of the polarity of the molecule in the adsorbed state. The reversal of the ordering of the valence states according to this model becomes a natural consequence of the relaxation of the equilibrium internuclear distance. The systematics in the adsorption super-structures and the variation of other adsorption parameters especially that of adsorption energy are considered for both group {VIII} and Ib metals are The characteristics of the vibrational properties of adsorbed {CO} on group {VIII} and Ib metals are considered in terms of the electronic properties with a view to obtain possible correlations in the future. The need for more accurate measurements to evaluate the 5σ−1π separation in the adsorbed state is indicated, which will enable, it is hoped, a synthesis to be made of a unified correlation between internuclear distance, ν(C−O) and Δ(5σ−1π) within a single framework model. The characteristics of nitrogen (isoelectronic with {CO}) adsorption on group {VIII} metals are also considered for comparison.},

Here we discuss in detail the mathematical formalism determining such moiré patterns based on concepts of two-dimensional Fourier transformation including coincidence lattices. The formalism provides simple relations that allow one to calculate possible moiré lattice vectors in their dependence on rotation angles α and scaling factors p 1, p 2 for periodic ( p1 × p 2) R α overlayers on substrate surfaces described by general Bravais lattices. Specific emphasis will be given to hexagonal lattices where experimental data are available.},

	volume = {44},
	issn = {0003-3022},
	abstract = {To study the cerebral protective effects of hypothermia in arterial hypoxia, anesthetized (70\% N2O), mechanically ventilated rats were cooled to a body temperature of 27 C. Hypoxia was induced by decreasing the oxygen content in the inspired gas mixture either to 6-7 per cent or to 2.5-3 per cent. This reduced mean {PaO}2 to about 25 and 11-12 torr, respectively. At {PaO}2 torr, there was no change in cerebral blood flow ({CBF}), cerebrla oxygen consumption ({CMRO}2), or labile tissue metabolites. The absence of signs of cerebral hypoxia could be attributed to an effect of temperature and {pH} on the hemoglobin-oxygen dissociation curve. Thus, at 27 C with a {PaO}2 of 25 torr the total oxygen content ({TO}2) of arterial blood remained greater than 15 ml (100 ml)-1, about three times the value obtained at this {PO}2 in normothermic rats. At {PaO}2 11-12 torr, arterial {TO}2 was reduced to about 5 ml (100 ml) (-1). The hypoxia induced no change in {CMRO}2, a threefold increase in {CBF}, a moderate lactacidosis in the tissue, and a small decrease in phosphocreatine content, but no change in {ATP}, {ADP}, or {AMP}. These changes are less marked than those occurring at the same arterial {TO}2 in normothermic rats. It is concluded that hypothermia exerts a pronounced protective effect on the brain in hypoxic hypoxia, and that two mechanisms are involved. First, since hypothermia shifts the oxyhemoglobin-dissociation curve towards the left, and prevents or minimizes a rightward shift due to acidosis, it maintains a high {TO}2 in arterial blood at a given {PaO}2. Second, by reducing {CMRO}2, and thereby presumably also cellular energy requirements, hypothermia exerts a protective effect at the cellular level.},

Effects of carotid chemoreceptor stimulation on coronary vascular resistance, left ventricular {dP}/dt, and strain-gauge arch output were studied at natural coronary blood flow with the chest closed and during constant-flow perfusion of the left common coronary artery with the chest open.

	title = {Protective effect of hypothermia in cerebral oxygen deficiency caused by arterial hypoxia},
	volume = {44},
	issn = {0003-3022},
	abstract = {To study the cerebral protective effects of hypothermia in arterial hypoxia, anesthetized (70\% N2O), mechanically ventilated rats were cooled to a body temperature of 27 C. Hypoxia was induced by decreasing the oxygen content in the inspired gas mixture either to 6-7 per cent or to 2.5-3 per cent. This reduced mean {PaO}2 to about 25 and 11-12 torr, respectively. At {PaO}2 torr, there was no change in cerebral blood flow ({CBF}), cerebrla oxygen consumption ({CMRO}2), or labile tissue metabolites. The absence of signs of cerebral hypoxia could be attributed to an effect of temperature and {pH} on the hemoglobin-oxygen dissociation curve. Thus, at 27 C with a {PaO}2 of 25 torr the total oxygen content ({TO}2) of arterial blood remained greater than 15 ml (100 ml)-1, about three times the value obtained at this {PO}2 in normothermic rats. At {PaO}2 11-12 torr, arterial {TO}2 was reduced to about 5 ml (100 ml) (-1). The hypoxia induced no change in {CMRO}2, a threefold increase in {CBF}, a moderate lactacidosis in the tissue, and a small decrease in phosphocreatine content, but no change in {ATP}, {ADP}, or {AMP}. These changes are less marked than those occurring at the same arterial {TO}2 in normothermic rats. It is concluded that hypothermia exerts a pronounced protective effect on the brain in hypoxic hypoxia, and that two mechanisms are involved. First, since hypothermia shifts the oxyhemoglobin-dissociation curve towards the left, and prevents or minimizes a rightward shift due to acidosis, it maintains a high {TO}2 in arterial blood at a given {PaO}2. Second, by reducing {CMRO}2, and thereby presumably also cellular energy requirements, hypothermia exerts a protective effect at the cellular level.},

	abstract = {Coronary vascular and myocardial responses to selective hypoxic and/or hypercapnic carotid chemoreceptor stimulation were investigated in constantly ventilated, pentobarbital or urethan-chloralose anesthetized dogs. Bilaterally isolated carotid chemoreceptors were perfused with autologous blood of varying O2 and {CO}2 tensions via an extracorporeal lung circuit. Systemic gas tensions were unchanged. Effects of carotid chemoreceptor stimulation on coronary vascular resistance, left ventricular {dP}/dt, and strain-gauge arch output were studied at natural coronary blood flow with the chest closed and during constant-flow perfusion of the left common coronary artery with the chest open. Carotid chemoreceptor stimulation slightly increased left ventricular {dP}/dt and slightly decreased the strain-gauge arch output, while markedly increasing systemic pressure. Coronary blood flow increased; however, coronary vascular resistance wa.as not affected. These studies show that local carotid body stimulation increases coronary blood flow but has little effect on the myocardium. The increase in coronary blood flow results mainly from an increase in systemic arterial pressure. Thus these data provide little evidence for increased sympathetic activity of the heart during local stimulation of the carotid chemoreceptors with hypoxic and hypercapnic blood.},

Moderate hypothermia with surface cooling and hemodilution perfusion with 5 per cent D/W was evaluated in 32 mongrel dogs and 16 clinical open heart cases. The results obtained here were as follow: 1) Body temperature reduction by surface cooling before bypass provided more even cooling than did core cooling by low flow partial bypass alone. 2) In regard to cardiac loading on returning the whole perfusate of the circuit to patient, approximately 20 ml/kg of 5 per cent D/W was feasible as a priming solution. 3) To reduce the blood visicosity, hemodilution technique with 5 per cent D/W was superior, and hemodilution effect during postoperative periods was temporaly. 4) The excess lactate volume postulated by Huckabee was a available index to evaluate metabolic acidosis during the extracorporeal circulation. 5) With aid of surface cooling, the acid-base balance during perfusion was kept to lesser extent than that of core cooling only. 6) This study indicated that the low priming perfusion in conjunction with surface cooling hypothermia was a reliable technique for the open heart operation and may be applied in more prolonged perfusion.},

	volume = {413},
	issn = {0006-3002},
	abstract = {The (Na+ +K+)-activated, Mg2+-dependent {ATPase} from rabbit kidney outer medulla was prepared in a partially inactivated, soluble form depleted of endogenous phospholipids, using deoxycholate. This preparation was reactivated 10 to 50-fold by sonicated liposomes of phosphatidylserine, but not by non-sonicated phosphatidylserine liposomes or sonicated phosphatidylcholine liposomes. The reconstituted enzyme resembled native membrane preparations of (Na+ +K+)-{ATPase} in its {pH} optimum being around 7.0, showing optimal activity at Mg2+:{ATP} mol ratios of approximately 1 and a Km value for {ATP} of 0.4 {mM}. Arrhenius plots of this reactivated activity at a constant {pH} of 7.0 and an Mg2+: {ATP} mol ratio of 1:1 showed a discontinuity (sharp change of slope) at 17 degrees C, with activation energy (Ea) values of 13-15 kcal/mol above this temperature and 30-35 kcal below it. A further discontinuity was also found at 8.0 degrees C and the Ea below this was very high (greater than 100 kcal/mol). Increased Mg2+ concentrations at Mg2+:{ATP} ratios in excess of 1:1 inhibited the (Na+ +K+)-{ATPase} activity and also abolished the discontinuities in the Arrhenius plots. The addition of cholesterol to phosphatidylserine at a 1:1 mol ratio partially inhibited (Na+ +K+)-{ATPase} reactivation. Arrhenius plots under these conditions showed a single discontinuity at 20 degrees C and Ea values of 22 and 68 kcal/mol above and below this temperature respectively. The ouabain-insensitive Mg2+-{ATPase} normally showed a linear Arrhenius plot with an Ea of 8 kcal/mol. The cholesterol-phosphatidylserine mixed liposomes stimulated the Mg2+-{ATPase} activity, which now also showed a discontinuity at 20 degrees C with, however, an increased value of 14 kcal/mol above this temperature and 6 kcal/mol below. Kinetic studies showed that cholesterol had no significant effect on the Km values for {ATP}. Since both cholesterol and Mg2+ are known to alter the effects of temperature on the fluidity of phospholipids, the above results are discussed in this context.},
