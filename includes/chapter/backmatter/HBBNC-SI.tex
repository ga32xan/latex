While at 650 meV only the core contributes to the DOS, energies of 1200 meV and 1600 meV are located on the leg and edge positions respectively.}

	\caption{Conformational change of a monomer after several scans with the AFM. First the molecule starts with an orientation of the legs in 1: clockwise, 2: counterclockwise, 3: clockwise. After several scans in close proximity (how far?!) legs at positions 2 and 3 flip around and change their orientation to 1: clockwise, 2: clockwise, 3: counterclockwise. This results in a changed adsorption geometry. First the upper right edge is lifted from the substrate, while after the leg rearrangement the lower right edge is lifted from the surface. This is caused by the lower lying dimethyl groups lifting the phenyl ring and the molecules edge.}
