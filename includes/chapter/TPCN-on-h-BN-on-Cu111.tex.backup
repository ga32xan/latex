% This is TPCN on h-BN on Cu(111).
After cleaning the metal surface of the Cu(111) crystal a sub-ML of h-BN has been grown ()
When TPCN is evaporated onto a grown sub-ML h-BN layer (on Cu(111)), the following applies:

When a h-BN spacer layer is introduced, the molecules decouple from the substrate, lowering their interaction with the afore-mentioned. This can be seen in a change of the molecules footprint (rectangular $\rightarrow$ square).

They do not form ordered networks (like chains or squares) and lie loosely on the h-BN layer. They can easily be moved with the STM tip (1V, 10nA). In some areas, denser TPCN islands form. Here they lie right next to each other, each slightly shifted to match the neighbouring molecules and to achieve the dense packed regions.
