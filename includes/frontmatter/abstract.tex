Good quality, two dimensional, hexagonal boron nitride (\textit{h}-BN) islands require a clean and flat surface to grow on. Within this thesis, techniques to chemically polish the surface are shortly reviewed. After polishing, the growth of sub-monolayer \textit{h}-BN islands is investigated on poly crystalline copper surfaces by means of STM and XPS. The use of \textit{h}-BN, grown on these foils as insulating and electronically decoupling substrate, is shown by reproducing molecular adsorption known on \textit{h}-BN grown on single crystalline copper.

Different molecular species are investigated with regard to their electronic properties and geometric structures, formed by self-assembly on metallic and insulating \textit{h}-BN substrates.

Bis- \& Tetra-pyridin-4-ylethynyl functionalized pyrene molcules are adsorped on \textit{h}-BN/Cu(111) to show the diversity of self-assembled molecular assemblies that can be steered by the number and position of functional groups. It is shown that their opto-electronic properties and assembly after adsorption are determined by the chemical design of the molecule and show the same trend as gas-phase calculations: An decrease in electronic band gap with increasing number of functional groups. Frontier orbital resolution is achieved in STM under modified tip conditions and a wide band gap in STS shows efficient decoupling from the metallic substrate by the \textit{h}-BN layer. 

Self-assembly and electronic structure of functionalized coronene molecules are investigated on Ag(111) and Au(111) surfaces. The importance of side groups in the formation process of self-assembled structures is clarified in STM. nc-AFM is used to clarify sub-molecular structure and the formation of linked structures after annealing treatment in UHV.

Single and bis- nitro functionalized porphine molecules are adsorbed on Cu, Ag and \textit{h}-BN/Cu(111). Di-tert-butyl-phenyl side groups are used to further decouple the molecule from the substrate layer and increase mobility at low temperatures. The molecular self-assembly is controlled by the number of functional groups, so that bis-functionalized molecules adsorbed on Ag(100) form hexagonal superstructures with, mismatching the 2-fold symmetric substrate symmetry.
	
Helicene molecules are used to investigate the influence of chirality and dipole moment on the formation of self-assembled islands. Depending on the substrate, molecular assembly varies from chains formed with specific orientation to the metal substrate's high symmetry directions to dense packed islands formed after adsorption on \textit{h}-BN/Cu(111). Annealing after adsorption on Ag resulted in a ring-closure reaction at the helicene's spiral terminations that lifts chirality.

At last a design for a peltier cooling unit is given, which is used to store liquids with a volume of serveral \SI{}{\milli \liter} at temperatures around \SI{0}{\celsius}.
