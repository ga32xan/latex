``How surface bonding and repulsive interactions cause phase transformations`` 
example: 2H-P on Ag(111):

The ordering of the molecules is induced by:
\begin{itemize}
 \item [attractive interactions:]
 \item formation of regular arrangements in sub-ML regime due to the short range character of interactions
 \item homogeneous structuring only (if at all) possible at high coverages
 \item [$\rightarrow$] different structural domains with domain boundaries
 \item [repulsive interactions:]
 \item molecules behave like lattice gas
 \item this leads to homogeneous
\end{itemize}
