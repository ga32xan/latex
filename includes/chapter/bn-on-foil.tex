Further experiments were carried out to increase the cleanliness of the \textit{h}-BN on the polycrystalline copper foil. To reduce the amount of elements coming from the body of the foil, it is repeatedly sputtered and annealed to temperatures as high as \SI{800}{\celsius}. This may have also an improving influence on the grain size and amount of corrugation. Several attempts have been made which are described in summary below.

\section{Characterization of clean copper foil}
\begin{itemize}
 \item After cleaning, the sample is investigated in STM. The foil shows a inhomogeneous topography, with parts of the sample showing very flat regions while others still remain heavily corrugated and not scan able in STM. 
 A first look onto the quite heterogeneous surface reveals flat areas with a typical roughness of $\approx \SI{70}{\pico\meter}$ exist (\autoref{fig:cu-foil-clean}). Areas with very large corrugations $\geq \SI{100}{nm}$ are hard to scan in STM and bad places for \textit{h}-BN growth. Although being flat, the polycrystalline foil shows a lot of unordered substrate steps and a dirty surface, covered with adsorbates imaged as small bright dots.
\end{itemize}

 \item The foil was sputtered and annealed 4 times with temperatures of \SI{800}{\celsius}. Borazine was dosed at \SI{2e-7}{\milli \bar} for \SI{2.5}{\minute}. The sample was kept at \SI{750}{\celsius} for another 5 minutes after dosing. The sample was cooled down slowly. \autoref{fig:h-bn-overgrown-cu-1} shows some of the grown islands. The copper surface changes upon \textit{h}-BN growth and the terrace width increases below the \textit{h}-BN flakes. The typical faceting of the surface vanishes or can at least not be depicted because of the overgrowing \textit{h}-BN (\autoref{fig:h-bn-overgrown-cu-2}).

Borazine was dosed with the same pressure as before (\SI{1e-7}{\milli \bar}) but for 1min and at a lower temperature of \SI{750}{\celsius}. After the preparation the sample was kept at \SI{750}{\celsius} for another 1 minute. It was cooled down slowly (shown in \autoref{fig:F150416-192611} and \autoref{fig:h-bn-overgrown-cu}).

 \item Look at Messzeit-April.ppt power point presentation
 \item Stufenh\"ohe
 \item Beschaffenheit der stufen/facetts $\rightarrow$ material transport mechanism/strength differs under the h-BN compared to the bare cu-foil surface.

\paragraph{surface structure of \textit{h}-BN on Cu-foil}
During experiments some ``new'' structure appeared (compare figure \ref{fig:tpcn-on-cu-foil}).
The apparent height change between the both terraces is \SI{130}{\pico \meter} separated by a slim trench that is slightly lower than the right terrace (\SI{50}{\pico \meter}). The parallel stripes have an apparent corrugation of \SI{25}{\pico \meter} and are separated \SI{70}{\pico \meter} from each other and cover the whole image. 

The adsorbed TPCN molecules show different apparent heights in their molecular center. Some fragmented and heavily deformed molecules are visible.

Two terraces are visible, both covered with linear stripes - oxygen over layer (2x1)?- cu reconstruction? - maybe some very small (\SI{0.75}{\nm}) linear moire on a Cu(100) facet? Noise can be excluded due to the fact that the stripes do not occur on the molecules, but only on the substrate. Adsorbed TPCN molecules appear as cross shaped protrusions.
